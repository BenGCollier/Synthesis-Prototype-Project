# Networking and Cybersecurity: Skills & Knowledge Assessment

## Strengths
- Network analytics came easy to interpret.
- Nessus was particularly helpful in learning about and analyzing networks.
- Tools such as Zenmap, Wireshark, and ShieldsUP! were easy to use and effective for running scans.
- Creating and interpreting visualizations in CIDM 6356 was straightforward.

## Weaknesses
- Due to my inexperience in networking, some terminology was difficult to grasp.
- I was unable to analyze a large business network with multiple devices.
- Zenmap scans took significantly longer than expected.
- I struggled with the Daubert Standard assignment.

## Wants/Wishes
- Gain more experience with larger network environments and complex network topologies.
- Develop a deeper understanding of cybersecurity risk assessments and penetration testing.
- Master advanced forensic techniques for fraud detection and cybersecurity.

# Networking and Cybersecurity: Integration

## Why and How Networking and Cybersecurity is Integrable with Other Areas
- Cybersecurity principles can be applied to data management and systems development to enhance security protocols and risk mitigation strategies.
- Network security concepts overlap with data mining when analyzing cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing techniques complement system development best practices.

## How Networking and Cybersecurity is Integrable with Prior Work
- Previous experience with Python, SQL, and web development strengthens my ability to automate cybersecurity tasks and analyze network data.
- Understanding of data visualization helps in interpreting network traffic and identifying anomalies.
- Familiarity with system development tools like Django, Docker, and Linux environments enhances my ability to implement secure applications.

## Integration Statement
Networking and cybersecurity play a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of data, applications, and systems. By integrating cybersecurity principles with my knowledge of system development, data mining, and management, I can build robust and secure solutions that safeguard sensitive information and prevent cyber threats.

## Preparedness
I have a solid foundation in network scanning, security assessment, and fraud detection. While some terminology and advanced concepts were initially challenging, hands-on experience with various tools helped me grasp key ideas. I feel prepared to apply these skills to real-world cybersecurity and networking tasks.
