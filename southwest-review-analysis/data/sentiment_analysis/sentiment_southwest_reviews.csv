Terrible.  Worst flight I’ve ever taken anywhere in the world.  Passenger next to me never put his seat belt on and the cabin crew did not ever check the cabin.  They were too taken up cracking childish jokes as though the whole flight was a joke to them.   Said passenger was also texting and receiving texts during landing.  Airline safety surely isn’t a joke?,terrible worst flight ive ever taken anywhere world passenger next never put seat belt cabin crew ever check cabin taken cracking childish jokes though whole flight joke said passenger also texting receiving texts landing airline safety surely isnt joke,negative
My luggage was irreparably damaged by their baggage handlers whern I arrived at my destination.  I had a dent and a gauge or hole in my luggage. They said the dent was normal wear and tear but the hole was their liability. Do they gave me a voucher for $50 for a future flight. I took my luggage and the repair person said it was not repairable. I complained through Better Business Bureau and this time Southwest went back on their orginal statement and said this was normal wear and tear.  So I am out a lot of money for a new bag. Southwest does not really save you money for any money I saved on the flight will be spent on new luggage. I will never fly Southwest again. I had a similar incident a long time ago with Delta where they put an irreparable hole in my luggage and they paid me for a new bag. Delta maybe more expensive but they are at least honest.,luggage irreparably damaged baggage handlers whern arrived destination dent gauge hole luggage said dent normal wear tear hole liability gave voucher future flight took luggage repair person said repairable complained better business bureau time southwest went back orginal statement said normal wear tear lot money new bag southwest really save money money saved flight spent new luggage never fly southwest similar incident long time ago delta put irreparable hole luggage paid new bag delta maybe expensive least honest,positive

"I had the worst experience flying with Southwest Airlines. My family of five travels together with one large luggage to keep things simple and convenient. However, on our return flight, they charged us an extra $200 because our luggage was exceeding the standard size by just 5 inches. This is absolutely ridiculous! We could have easily checked in 5 smaller bags, each included in the price, but that would have taken up more space in the compartment and added more weight — making this policy clearly about squeezing more money out of customers, not about space or weight. To make matters worse, we weren't charged this fee on the flight in, but only on the way out. They claimed they changed the policy during our vacation, which felt like a total scam. This is pure corporate greed! I will never fly with Southwest again. Avoid this airline at all costs — they are nothing but scammers and crooks!",worst experience flying southwest airlines family five travels together one large luggage keep things simple convenient however return flight charged us extra luggage exceeding standard size inches absolutely ridiculous could easily checked smaller bags included price would taken space compartment added weight making policy clearly squeezing money customers space weight make matters worse werent charged fee flight way claimed changed policy vacation felt like total scam pure corporate greed never fly southwest avoid airline costs nothing scammers crooks,negative

"This review is strictly my opinion.  My review is based upon changes that the airline has made, will make, or probable changes in the future.  SWA continues to devalue Rapid Rewards (as it has done time and time again) and has upcoming plans to further devalue.  They will begin implementing much less fair dynamic points pricing.  This will make their rewards program much less advantageous compared to other airlines.  SWA will begin checked-bag fees.  They have always been ahead of the pack in the past with no bag fees.  This will be going away.   Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA will start assigning seats (which implies charging for seats).  They are becoming their competitors, which is insanely unnecessary. Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Not only is SWA devaluing their reward points, they may also add expirations to points.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA may soon worsen flight credit expiration; which may naturally lead to charges for cancelled or changed flights.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Anticipated future changes are higher obstacles to acquire A-list, A-list preferred, and companion pass status; as well as reducing the perks and value.  SWA may even start charging for carry-on bags.  All of this makes them much less competitive and much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  I believe that they are repeatedly punching the guts of their long-time loyal customers.  None of their changes will inspire loyalty.  These changes will be quite advantageous to the other airlines as customers will be driven away into the waiting arms of the other carriers.  The leadership at SWA has landed themselves into positions that they don't belong in and have absolutely no business in.   It is obvious that SWA is trading long-term success and loyalty for short-term profits.  This is all both sad and maddening.  I hope that the majority share holders can smell the stink of all these changes and kick the current decision makers to the curb.  I wish you all luck with choosing other airlines.",review strictly opinion review based upon changes airline made make probable changes future swa continues devalue rapid rewards done time time upcoming plans devalue begin implementing much less fair dynamic points pricing make rewards program much less advantageous compared airlines swa begin checkedbag fees always ahead pack past bag fees going away much less advantageous compared airlines swa start assigning seats implies charging seats becoming competitors insanely unnecessary much less advantageous compared airlines swa devaluing reward points may also add expirations points much less advantageous compared airlines swa may soon worsen flight credit expiration may naturally lead charges cancelled changed flights much less advantageous compared airlines anticipated future changes higher obstacles acquire alist alist preferred companion pass status well reducing perks value swa may even start charging carryon bags makes much less competitive much less advantageous compared airlines believe repeatedly punching guts longtime loyal customers none changes inspire loyalty changes quite advantageous airlines customers driven away waiting arms carriers leadership swa landed positions dont belong absolutely business obvious swa trading longterm success loyalty shortterm profits sad maddening hope majority share holders smell stink changes kick current decision makers curb wish luck choosing airlines,negative
I purchased EarlyBird Checkin for a total of $40 for one trip. I got B25. They claimed 70 people were ahead of me with priority of A-List and A-List Preferred. I don't believe this at all!

"Southwest Airlines has long prided itself on being different than other airlines: from free checked bags to open seating, many distinguishing factors led me as well as millions of other customers to choose Southwest. That era is sadly at an end. With the adoption of a “penny-wise, pound-foolish” approach, Southwest’s decision to end the aforementioned features will likely result in customers abandoning it for other airlines. I grew up using Southwest, as it is a “family-friendly” airline through the baggage and seating policy. Now, little is left policy-wise to distinguish it from any other airline and the “family-friendly” factor is lost. I highly doubt that I will hear the words “thank you for choosing Southwest” after a flight ever again after they have chosen to shift away from consumers and long-term reputation towards investors and short-term revenue prioritization.",southwest airlines long prided different airlines free checked bags open seating many distinguishing factors led well millions customers choose southwest era sadly end adoption pennywise poundfoolish approach southwests decision end aforementioned features likely result customers abandoning airlines grew using southwest familyfriendly airline baggage seating policy little left policywise distinguish airline familyfriendly factor lost highly doubt hear words thank choosing southwest flight ever chosen shift away consumers longterm reputation towards investors shortterm revenue prioritization,positive

"Deeply Disappointed - Unprofessional and Unhelpful StaffI am a frequent Southwest flyer, and while I generally appreciate the airline, the Oakland location stands out for all the wrong reasons. The staff here have consistently been the rudest, least helpful airline employees I have encountered--not just within Southwest, but across any airline l've flown.It is abundantly clear that many of them do not want to be there, and unfortunately, they take that frustration out on the very people they are paid to assist-the customers. Their attitude is not just indifferent; it's actively hostile. Rather than providing solutions, they seem determined to find any possible reason to make the travel experience more difficult, whether that means creating unnecessary issues with baggage or simply refusing to be accommodating in even the smallest ways. I have been to this location multiple times and this has been my experience every time.This starkly contrasts with my experiences at Burbank Airport, where the Southwest crew is consistently welcoming, professional, and genuinely helpful. It's disappointing that such a dramatic difference exists within the same airline.Southwest as a company should seriously reevaluate the customer service culture at its Oakland location, because right now, it's doing a disservice to both the airline's reputation and its loyal passengers.",deeply disappointed unprofessional unhelpful staffi frequent southwest flyer generally appreciate airline oakland location stands wrong reasons staff consistently rudest least helpful airline employees encounterednot within southwest across airline lve flownit abundantly clear many want unfortunately take frustration people paid assistthe customers attitude indifferent actively hostile rather providing solutions seem determined find possible reason make travel experience difficult whether means creating unnecessary issues baggage simply refusing accommodating even smallest ways location multiple times experience every timethis starkly contrasts experiences burbank airport southwest crew consistently welcoming professional genuinely helpful disappointing dramatic difference exists within airlinesouthwest company seriously reevaluate customer service culture oakland location right disservice airlines reputation loyal passengers,negative
I generally like Southwest.  However there’s some airline employees that simply are not intelligent.  First we are told that the upper storage is small.  I’ve brought the same bag a dozen times on various plane types but this is a MAX8.  It’s a newer plane and storage is more than ample and was designed that way!!!.  I know she’s wrong but I compact it even more.   She measures it and tells me I need to check it.  So while I know she’s a flaming idiot I comply because it is a commie process and they can decide if you fly or not.  I get on board after checking my bag.  Over the intercom they say that the bins are large.  Ok.  Which is it Southwest?  Shouldn’t the attendants know what the hell they are saying and doing?   Now I have a checked bag because we an have an idiot at the gate who is using an old baggage sizing for an old plane.  Some people just never figured out how to fit the square block in the square hole and are now controlling people that passed that test with flying colors!!!!  Please do something about these people because I’m slowly moving towards delta.   It’s way more convenient but not a direct flight…. It seems it may be worth it though especially when you go to assigned seating… I’m sitting here hating Southwest right now because I have to abide by rude controlling people that are less intelligent then me.,generally like southwest however theres airline employees simply intelligent first told upper storage small ive brought bag dozen times various plane types max newer plane storage ample designed way know shes wrong compact even measures tells need check know shes flaming idiot comply commie process decide fly get board checking bag intercom say bins large ok southwest shouldnt attendants know hell saying checked bag idiot gate using old baggage sizing old plane people never figured fit square block square hole controlling people passed test flying colors please something people im slowly moving towards delta way convenient direct flight seems may worth though especially go assigned seating im sitting hating southwest right abide rude controlling people less intelligent,positive

"I am usually reluctant to write reviews because consumer facing business is difficult. But Southwest Airlines is a miserable experience top to bottom, especially with all forms of phone support. Customer care treated me with extreme rudeness and then outright hostility when I was unable to change my password that appeared in a data breach of their services. Ultimately, after being yelled at I was hung up on. I called back and not one but two customer care reps were unable to find a record of the call or the email I was sent from their system. The website is a relic with subpar performance and security. No one seems to care. I can only assume this level of mediocrity extends to all services including the safety of air travel. Years ago, SW was a great company, but they are stuck in the past and it's reflected across the board.

"It is ridiculous that Southwest allows a family of four to earn points together when they fly, but then they can’t book together when using the points and requires each family member including kids to book their own flight separately.

The individuals at gates C11 C12 & C14 would not help, to busy talking amongst themselves to help. Once again, terrible customer service.

I expressed how I could see the tickets on the app (even after refreshing) and after 20 mins, was able to get the agent to split my reservation so my wife's ticket was $523 and my ticket was $840.

"On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertantly gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket , so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name!! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money!! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place. It would hurt Southwest in no way, shape or form to simply return the flight credit back to me. They still get the $711 revenue. The paper trail is there. They can clearly see the mistake of the duplicate ticket and they obviously know how their 'rules' twist this mistake all around to cheat me out of $711. I will never fly Southwest again!!

"We made sure that we are on the correct gate according to the screens. Turns out that the screens were incorrect and the speakers didn’t work. A Southwest Airlines lady claimed that she told the group waiting here to switch gates. We were sitting there the whole time (for 1,5 h) and the information didn’t reach us. They weren’t also calling our names before closing the gate.Getting a refund was also tricky because they claimed it was our fault. Luckily I took a picture of the incorrect screen during departure time.I got vouchers and was forced to use southwest airlines once more.

He immediately snapped cutting me off and said something like, “if you don’t like it, write a letter to Southwest”. I couldn’t believe it.I had tried to ask him nicely and he was doubling down. He continued, “this is not your property, if you think it is ok to deface someone else’s property, then write a letter to Southwest”.I was calm and was trying to talk to him discreetly, but he was loud and made a scene.I said, “I didn’t say anything about WHAT you said, I’m talking about ‘how’ you said it”.

The flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix was beautiful and have no complaints there. But at Sky Harbor airport at Baggage Claim my suitcase is purple and it's a plastic one with a pink name tag. Also the zipper that you can open to expand doesn't zip all the way. So I saw my suitcase and grabbed it bc of those identifiers. About 20 minutes later southwest representative calls me and said I had the wrong suitcase and of course I was so embarrassed and my step dad takes me back to the airport we were 20 minutes away. I get there and was apologizing a lot. The one Southwest employee a black woman went off on me and I was blown away. It was uncalled for and she was about to be recorded. So then I explained to the male employee what through me off and he agreed when be looked at the suitcases side by side that zipper was like mine and the pink tag like mineYes I should have looked at my name and I learned a lesson from it. And the person who the suitcase belong to was so ignorant I understood she was upset I would be also.

It’s hit and miss on flight experience. Some attendants are rude. DO NOT purchase their internet. It is the worst. All other airlines are better. They are always in the crappiest parts of airports.

"We have been flying Southwest Air for many years.  Well, yesterday on Flight 1571 from LAX to BWI, we experienced the worse flight of our life.  There was an older Flight Attendant that was not allowing people to get to the bathroom, she tossed snacks at you, and yelled loudly at an elderly gentleman.  The Lead Flight Attendant told us that WiFi would not be available on our flight.  For almost five (5) hours, we listened at crying, loud babies and kids.  My Husband called today to complain about the problems and was pretty much blown off by another older sounding woman at their Corporate Office.  Their flights are now full, the bottom of the seat is thin and if you are sitting in front of a child, you could be kicked in your back the entire flight—my experience.

SWA has a number of good features like low prices - we do not pay for upgrade to sit closer to the front - and SWA does not charge for checked bags.

"On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request.The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience.I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies.I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience. I will be choosing American Airlines for future travel.",encountered unexpected issue attempting check southwest flight airport despite booked flight month advance family funeral trip scheduled informed southwest agent needed consent form sisters travel minor niece nephew requirement unfamiliar previously traveled minors southwest airlines without encountering requestthe interaction agent supervisor disheartening exhibited rudeness disrespect towards despite explanations requests show willingness review travel history minors consider circumstances familys bereavement additionally given conflicting information acceptance notarized letter minors guardian causing confusion inconveniencei respectfully request review incident caused distress already challenging time hope feedback contribute improvements customer service clarity travel requirements passengers particularly sensitive situations family emergenciesi difficult experience southwest airlines unable board flight encountered unhelpful customer service despite received refund booked american airlines positive experience choosing american airlines future travel,positive
"TSA randomly selects people for a secondary screening at the gate, which is out of all airlines control. However, with most airlines assigned seating, this only affects the flight you are selected for the screening for and doesn’t affect your boarding. With Southwest’s check in and reservation system, getting selected for secondary screening means you are in for major issues. Southwest’s well rehearsed response by phone support, check in personnel and gate agents, for the multiple impacts, is that it is not our fault’. That you were selected by the TSA, not Southwest, so you get nothing from Southwest to help rectify the situation of getting a late C group number when you went to all the trouble to check in and your spouse on the same reservation gets A group.It is true that it is TSA for being selected for the extra secondary security screening for the first flight. However, all the issues on subsequent connecting fights are caused by Southwest's reservation system and boarding process. There is no reason not to get assigned your legitimate place in line on the rest of your connecting flights as the TSA screening has nothing to do with them. Even worse then not being able to board with the rest of your party on the reservation on subsequent flights, is losing your TSA Pre Check from paying for Global Entry on the rest of your connecting flights. On international flights you usually need to go through security again after clearing customs. On my recent trip back from Mexico, the rest of my party with TSA Pre Check cleared security in 5 minutes and then waited another 50 minutes for me to finally show up. This is very much Southwest's issue. Other airlines with different reservation systems have none of these issues.There are things that Southwest could have and should have done on my connecting flight. I clearly should have had an A group number as all other folks on the reservation with me did. All the numbers are gone since the Southwest system would not assign my connecting flight boarding position since it wouldn’t assign the 1st flight. However, Southwest lets ""special circumstance"" folks board after the A group, before the B group. When I asked the gate agent in Miami, Monica V., if there was anything I could do to board at least close to the rest of my party, she parroted the party line that is was TSA’s fault and that there was nothing she could do. When I mentioned boarding after the A’s, she got that hostile look like I was just another low life trouble maker trying to cheat my way onto the plane before my turn. She stated that was ONLY for disabled passengers and my issue was not a Southwest problem.An even better solution is for Southwest to still issue you your boarding position number for your connecting flights and not remove TSA PRE from your connecting flight boarding pass",tsa randomly selects people secondary screening gate airlines control however airlines assigned seating affects flight selected screening doesnt affect boarding southwests check reservation system getting selected secondary screening means major issues southwests well rehearsed response phone support check personnel gate agents multiple impacts fault selected tsa southwest get nothing southwest help rectify situation getting late c group number went trouble check spouse reservation gets groupit true tsa selected extra secondary security screening first flight however issues subsequent connecting fights caused southwests reservation system boarding process reason get assigned legitimate place line rest connecting flights tsa screening nothing even worse able board rest party reservation subsequent flights losing tsa pre check paying global entry rest connecting flights international flights usually need go security clearing customs recent trip back mexico rest party tsa pre check cleared security minutes waited another minutes finally show much southwests issue airlines different reservation systems none issuesthere things southwest could done connecting flight clearly group number folks reservation numbers gone since southwest system would assign connecting flight boarding position since wouldnt assign st flight however southwest lets special circumstance folks board group b group asked gate agent miami monica v anything could board least close rest party parroted party line tsas fault nothing could mentioned boarding got hostile look like another low life trouble maker trying cheat way onto plane turn stated disabled passengers issue southwest probleman even better solution southwest still issue boarding position number connecting flights remove tsa pre connecting flight boarding pass,negative

"Onboard SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight from Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale, just as the door closed to leave, I was assaulted by the Flight Attendant. As I was saying goodbye to my husband on my phone, a male flight attendant leaned past two passengers to jab his fingers into my shoulder. I was sitting in the window seat and suddenly felt pain in my shoulder from this male flight attendant's assault. I recently had rotator cuff surgery, and I was shocked that a man just poked me there. I am a 63 year old woman, and I pre-boarded due to disabilities. When I looked at him he said ""turn off your cell phone now"". The preparation announcements were just being made when this assault took place. As I said, I was telling my husband goodbye . With doors flying off, DEI hiring of pilots, and all the horrors of flying, I ALWAYS tell my husband I love him just before I take off. I did nothing wrong, and certainly, NO FLIGHT ATTENDANT HAS THE RIGHT TO JAB HIS HAND INTO ANYONE'S SHOULDER. Well, I contacted Southwest Airlines and they essentially called me a liar. (It took a month for a response from SWA) I provided them with full details and also a photograph of this flight attendant. Their delayed response was that the feedback of the crew member was that he did not recall. They quoted their policy: ""Once the entry doors are closed in preparation for pushback, cellular voice and data functions must be turned off"". So instead of being appalled and sorry for this assault, they implied somehow I did not know about turning off cell phones. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, yet NO ONE SHOULD BE physically assaulted by a flight attendant. SWA doesn't have the right to lay hands on a passenger. My complaint was completely blown off, and swept under the rug by SWA. They ended the correspondence by ""We hope you  will fly Southwest Airlines again and that your support and confidence is very important to us"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Why would I fly them again after they physically assaulted me? So after they assaulted a 63 year old woman with disabilities they took no responsibility, They we're very clear that somehow it was my fault that I was assaulted. Well, I am done flying SWA.
