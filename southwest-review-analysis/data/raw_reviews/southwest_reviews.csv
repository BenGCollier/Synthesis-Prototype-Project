Review
"Negative stars!  I had 4 flights for my family to get home extremely late.  I saw that they had a different one that worked to get us home earlier so I changed to that one for $575.  After getting to the airport, our new flight was delayed and now we will miss our connecting flight home.  They now have us on the original flight home because it's the only one and they won't refund me my 575 dollars that I paid when I changed my flight.  The lady at the kiosk was extremely rude, Joelene was her name.  She had no empathy and refused to take care of me after I called her on her rudeness.  She literally moved on to other customers and ignored me from there.  Delays happen, I get it but putting me back on my original flight home and keeping my 575 is a scam of all scams!!!  Don't use this garbage airline"
"Southwest Airlines is a great company and theONLY airline I will fly.  They are polite, considerate, affordable when compared to the others"
First and last time flying with this laires. They say that seat assignments are available 24 hours before the flight. Not a good experience.
Terrible.  Worst flight I’ve ever taken anywhere in the world.  Passenger next to me never put his seat belt on and the cabin crew did not ever check the cabin.  They were too taken up cracking childish jokes as though the whole flight was a joke to them.   Said passenger was also texting and receiving texts during landing.  Airline safety surely isn’t a joke?
My luggage was irreparably damaged by their baggage handlers whern I arrived at my destination.  I had a dent and a gauge or hole in my luggage. They said the dent was normal wear and tear but the hole was their liability. Do they gave me a voucher for $50 for a future flight. I took my luggage and the repair person said it was not repairable. I complained through Better Business Bureau and this time Southwest went back on their orginal statement and said this was normal wear and tear.  So I am out a lot of money for a new bag. Southwest does not really save you money for any money I saved on the flight will be spent on new luggage. I will never fly Southwest again. I had a similar incident a long time ago with Delta where they put an irreparable hole in my luggage and they paid me for a new bag. Delta maybe more expensive but they are at least honest.
"I have been a faithful customer of Southwest for years and have had mostly good experiences. I'm very disappointed, however, if the recent changes at Southwest - charging for baggage, reducing the length of time that flight credits can be used - I counted on these features. How I'll just start looking at Delta Airlines when I'm traveling."
"I had the worst experience flying with Southwest Airlines. My family of five travels together with one large luggage to keep things simple and convenient. However, on our return flight, they charged us an extra $200 because our luggage was exceeding the standard size by just 5 inches. This is absolutely ridiculous! We could have easily checked in 5 smaller bags, each included in the price, but that would have taken up more space in the compartment and added more weight — making this policy clearly about squeezing more money out of customers, not about space or weight. To make matters worse, we weren't charged this fee on the flight in, but only on the way out. They claimed they changed the policy during our vacation, which felt like a total scam. This is pure corporate greed! I will never fly with Southwest again. Avoid this airline at all costs — they are nothing but scammers and crooks!"
"This review is strictly my opinion.  My review is based upon changes that the airline has made, will make, or probable changes in the future.  SWA continues to devalue Rapid Rewards (as it has done time and time again) and has upcoming plans to further devalue.  They will begin implementing much less fair dynamic points pricing.  This will make their rewards program much less advantageous compared to other airlines.  SWA will begin checked-bag fees.  They have always been ahead of the pack in the past with no bag fees.  This will be going away.   Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA will start assigning seats (which implies charging for seats).  They are becoming their competitors, which is insanely unnecessary. Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Not only is SWA devaluing their reward points, they may also add expirations to points.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA may soon worsen flight credit expiration; which may naturally lead to charges for cancelled or changed flights.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Anticipated future changes are higher obstacles to acquire A-list, A-list preferred, and companion pass status; as well as reducing the perks and value.  SWA may even start charging for carry-on bags.  All of this makes them much less competitive and much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  I believe that they are repeatedly punching the guts of their long-time loyal customers.  None of their changes will inspire loyalty.  These changes will be quite advantageous to the other airlines as customers will be driven away into the waiting arms of the other carriers.  The leadership at SWA has landed themselves into positions that they don't belong in and have absolutely no business in.   It is obvious that SWA is trading long-term success and loyalty for short-term profits.  This is all both sad and maddening.  I hope that the majority share holders can smell the stink of all these changes and kick the current decision makers to the curb.  I wish you all luck with choosing other airlines."
I purchased EarlyBird Checkin for a total of $40 for one trip. I got B25. They claimed 70 people were ahead of me with priority of A-List and A-List Preferred. I don't believe this at all! This is a scummy airline. Now they're charging for bags when they used to brag about not charging and laugh at other airlines! I'll never fly them again and neither should you. They've gone downhill so fast!Every year since Robert Jordan was promoted to CEO in 2022 there has been a huge controversy. He is in WAY over his head and should be fired!!! He must go!
Trash airline that makes me give up my seat when I boarded first and now are charging for two bags. I have nothing good to say about this airline and I have been a loyal customer for years. They have lost my bags and treat their customers like garbage. Absolutely do not recommend
"Southwest Airlines has long prided itself on being different than other airlines: from free checked bags to open seating, many distinguishing factors led me as well as millions of other customers to choose Southwest. That era is sadly at an end. With the adoption of a “penny-wise, pound-foolish” approach, Southwest’s decision to end the aforementioned features will likely result in customers abandoning it for other airlines. I grew up using Southwest, as it is a “family-friendly” airline through the baggage and seating policy. Now, little is left policy-wise to distinguish it from any other airline and the “family-friendly” factor is lost. I highly doubt that I will hear the words “thank you for choosing Southwest” after a flight ever again after they have chosen to shift away from consumers and long-term reputation towards investors and short-term revenue prioritization."
HORRIBLE! Paid premium rates for my whole family to be priority A boarding and they let a whole bunch of people FAKING needing wheelchairs on the plane and my family and I were forced to sit far in the back despite paying premium prices where all the lying lifestyle fat people got to sit in the front seats and they all spread out since the flight wasn’t full so 1 fatty sat in a middle and they refused to move. The early “disabled” boarding should be forced  to the back of the plane.  If someone pays double or triple fare to guarantee front seats they should get their seats!! You lost this frequent flyer forever.
First and last time flying with this laires. They say that seat assignments are available 24 hours before the flight. Seat assignments are nowhere to be found.
Worst airline for seating - they have no policy to stop seat saving and the attendants are NO help.  I won't fly southwest again; worst experience flying in years!
"Flight cancelled and the rebooking flight is 12 hours later, have work the next day that im gonna have to miss yet they give no compensation or help for the great inconvinience that this caused. Greatly dissapointed"
"Wow, first time flying Southwest and never again. Their business far gives you nothing and then you add $150 for a bag that was 4lbs overweight made it more expensive than flying first class with a premium airline. Rude staff!"
I wouldn't fly with Southwest if it was free.  That's how bad it is.  The flight attendants are so abusive.  I received a credit due to the poor treatment I received but never used it.  Southwest is so bad I actually passed up a free flight.
"Deeply Disappointed - Unprofessional and Unhelpful StaffI am a frequent Southwest flyer, and while I generally appreciate the airline, the Oakland location stands out for all the wrong reasons. The staff here have consistently been the rudest, least helpful airline employees I have encountered--not just within Southwest, but across any airline l've flown.It is abundantly clear that many of them do not want to be there, and unfortunately, they take that frustration out on the very people they are paid to assist-the customers. Their attitude is not just indifferent; it's actively hostile. Rather than providing solutions, they seem determined to find any possible reason to make the travel experience more difficult, whether that means creating unnecessary issues with baggage or simply refusing to be accommodating in even the smallest ways. I have been to this location multiple times and this has been my experience every time.This starkly contrasts with my experiences at Burbank Airport, where the Southwest crew is consistently welcoming, professional, and genuinely helpful. It's disappointing that such a dramatic difference exists within the same airline.Southwest as a company should seriously reevaluate the customer service culture at its Oakland location, because right now, it's doing a disservice to both the airline's reputation and its loyal passengers."
I generally like Southwest.  However there’s some airline employees that simply are not intelligent.  First we are told that the upper storage is small.  I’ve brought the same bag a dozen times on various plane types but this is a MAX8.  It’s a newer plane and storage is more than ample and was designed that way!!!.  I know she’s wrong but I compact it even more.   She measures it and tells me I need to check it.  So while I know she’s a flaming idiot I comply because it is a commie process and they can decide if you fly or not.  I get on board after checking my bag.  Over the intercom they say that the bins are large.  Ok.  Which is it Southwest?  Shouldn’t the attendants know what the hell they are saying and doing?   Now I have a checked bag because we an have an idiot at the gate who is using an old baggage sizing for an old plane.  Some people just never figured out how to fit the square block in the square hole and are now controlling people that passed that test with flying colors!!!!  Please do something about these people because I’m slowly moving towards delta.   It’s way more convenient but not a direct flight…. It seems it may be worth it though especially when you go to assigned seating… I’m sitting here hating Southwest right now because I have to abide by rude controlling people that are less intelligent then me.
Do not waste your time or money booking with southwest cruises. The benefits they offer will not happen. I will never ever use this service again.
Open seating sucks. Boarding technique also horrible. No one checks line jumpers. No 1st class option. Zero premium anything here. Just one large overcrowded pushing and shoving compartment with the most uncomfortable seats of any airline. Fly another carrier if at all possible.
"I am usually reluctant to write reviews because consumer facing business is difficult. But Southwest Airlines is a miserable experience top to bottom, especially with all forms of phone support. Customer care treated me with extreme rudeness and then outright hostility when I was unable to change my password that appeared in a data breach of their services. Ultimately, after being yelled at I was hung up on. I called back and not one but two customer care reps were unable to find a record of the call or the email I was sent from their system. The website is a relic with subpar performance and security. No one seems to care. I can only assume this level of mediocrity extends to all services including the safety of air travel. Years ago, SW was a great company, but they are stuck in the past and it's reflected across the board. I can't say I'll never travel SW especially for short hops, but they will be the absolute last resort."
"First off I have over 100 thousand miles in the air with Delta in South African air so I should have book my flight with Delta but we went through a travel agent instead of doing it myself first mistake second mistake is accepting Southwest. The people are amazing No complaints there, but the company bought brand new planes and put an extra seat in them so now no room for a cart to go between the Aisle. The bathroom is so small that a big man like myself 6 foot tall 300 pounds barely fits in the bathroom and let me not even get on the seats I have marks on my back with the seatbelt rubbed my back from Vegas to Orlando airport. I never moved  I was afraid I wouldn’t get back in the chair. So my wife was in the middle of two 300 lbs men so at 117 lbs she did not enjoy her flight . I understand business trying to get the most people in a plane for the fuel cost but it $250 per person one way you would think they would think about the customer not their selves. Don’t worry I’ll never fly Southwest  again and I tell people Look at the reviews before you booking"
"It is ridiculous that Southwest allows a family of four to earn points together when they fly, but then they can’t book together when using the points and requires each family member including kids to book their own flight separately.  Seems like Southwest really needs to improve their policies and let a family with kids combine their points to book together on one account! Seems silly to make four family members all login separately to try to get flights. The points are becoming worthless.  Then, the kids each have separate flights not connected to the parents app and it becomes a problem. Hopefully Southwest sees this and fixes the issue to become more family, friendly!"
"Last Friday, a friend and I sought to change our return flight to Baltimore the following Monday, due to an anticipated snow storm. We were still in Baltimore when we tried to make the change, so we asked a staff member for help.  That staff member turned out to be a woman named Imani (#131603) and she was absolutely fantastic: understanding, efficient, kind, and effective.  The outcome was also perfect: We made it back without a hassle, safe and dry, and we didn't experience any of the weather delays that the storm caused the next day.  We are so grateful to Imani.  She was great!"
"My granddaughter is autistic and my daughter had a trip to Disney planned.  She wants to cancel her trip because my granddaughter's behavior flipped to agressive.  To save the the plane from being turned around or save the embarrassment of being kicked off the plane, she wants to cancel the trip.  Southwest will not refund her the money.She has saved for awhile for this trip.I think this is terrible.   Southwest is a bunch of greedy a** holes."
It is the worst airline I have ever experienced. The flight attendants are bad and rule the plane. We were not seated when we booked tickets for three together. they paid no attention to customer service. I have traveled across the world and this airline has just appointed me so badly. I would never again book Southwest Airlines even at the lowest price.This airline is worth a penny.
"I arrived in St. Louis from San Francisco ON 12/16/24. Upon arrival notified that final flight going to DFW was delayed. Then informed again flight was delayed as plane needed a part to continue. Young lady at ticket counter could barely speak as she had a face mask on and did not know how to use microphone. After an hour and asking questions, informed gate was switched from E16 to E36. Another ticket agent at this counter was very rude and disrespectful to elderly people in wheelchairs asking questions. What is the purpose of customer service if a ticket agent hates doing their job and takes their negative energy to others? Has this company forgotten what brought them customers? This was flight 1268 from St. Louis to Dallas. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FLYING SOUTHWEST OUT OF SAINT LOUIS!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS."
Flight #3834 on Sunday (Dec 15th).  The flight is over 1 hour and a half delayed and we are all boarded the flight and frustrated that we are still not moving.  Flight attendants are laughing and having fun and showing zero empathy for the passengers who have been delayed over 1 hour and half.  We are all just sitting in our seats waiting to depart and the flight attendants are joking around and laughing while we are all waiting to depart.  Poor example of not reading the crowd by the Flight Attendants.  Show some empathy.
They want to gouge customers when changing flight times. Its just insane how they treat you and want to squeeze every last dime out of you. Another airline on its way out.
"I recently experienced what I consider to be terrible customer service from every level of customer service from checkin to boarding of the aircraft. I was flying from Las Vegas to Boise and it was a Saturday early evening. I tried to checkin at the counter downstairs where the lady waved me over and then said, Go check in at the self checkin. I had questions, but she wouldn't help, she said, you dont have bags so go checkin at self checkout.  I was taken back by her rudeness, and there was nobody ahead of me or behind me. Then, I get upstairs and am trying to get through to my gate, and the information on my boarding pass didnt match my gate information. The individuals at gates C11 C12 & C14 would not help, to busy talking amongst themselves to help. Once again, terrible customer service. Then prior to boarding, the Southwest Airline attendant allowed families with dogs to go first, not disabled, veterans or people needing extra time. This is crazy! I had pre boarding but, I could barely get to the counter because his lack of controlling people around his desk area. When trying to scan my boarding pass, it was not working, so the attendant grabbed my phone and slammed it on the scanner. I am not impressed by the rudeness, the lack of customer service and disrespect to myself and my property. If you hate the job, find a new one, because the service and unhelpful attitudes does nothing for your sinking airline!"
"When attempting to update my trip (Wanna Get Away Plus) from Sunday flight to a Saturday flight, I was able to select 2 seats for $523 using the app. However, the app does not allow you to update a reservation when you have a lap child (a very ridiculous restriction).I immediately called southwest, and they informed me the tickets were now $840. I expressed how I could see the tickets on the app (even after refreshing) and after 20 mins, was able to get the agent to split my reservation so my wife's ticket was $523 and my ticket was $840. They were unable to honor the price I should have received if the app had just worked. Further, the agent was not able to come up with this solution - I had to suggest it in order to reduce my additional cost from $700 and something to $380.Overall, I am very disappointed in southwest and hope they can resolve this issue."
"I would've not even rated the service a 1 star. We are disappointed as a company to learn that we are not able to transfer flight credit for other employers when traveling due to travel change. We will not receive a refund, and the flight credit is useless. We have spent so much money using Southwest Airlines and now our company will never use this travel airline ever.Company out there that uses Southwest for travel I warn you now not to book. If you have any last-minute emergency or changes to your employee travel, you're wasting money!!"
"Southwest Airlines flight on 11/21 at 5:45 AM from Tulsa to St. Louis.Pilots were late for first flight of the day, delaying departure.Crew announced there would be no beverage service due to turbulence.One of the smoothest flights one could have taken.Very unexpected and dissappointing from an airline that had been known for wowing customers with great service,"
Watch the early-bird check-in as it says guaranteed A1-A15 boarding we ended up with A60 and B1. Might as well have taken our chances and saved some money.
"This airline is amazing! It had complimentary drinks and water! The seats were comfy, and the leg room was spectacular. 10/10, would recommend!"
"I want to give a big thank you to Onnie, the flight attendant on Southwest Flight #2913 from Chicago Midway to Cincinnati on October 28, 2024. His patience and kindness, especially with a mother and her young child, truly stood out. He went out of his way to make their flight smoother and more comfortable. The Non-GMO snacks were a nice touch too! It was a wonderful experience, and we’ll definitely be flying Southwest again."
"One of the best airlines for me at least, never had a problem with the airline, always had the best experience with southwest."
"I love your direct comment to Boeing this week; The CEOs of Southwest Airlines and American Airlines both want Boeing to deliver planes on time.Too bad our flight from Costa Rica wasn't on time and we had to stay overnight in Houston with a little over $500.00 in expenses that was denied by your company since it wasn't your fault!! Nothing compared to the $6.1 billion dollars Boeing is losing but to hard-working people it goes a long way. American Airlines, Delta, JSX....any one except Southwest will get our money for flights next time."
"On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertantly gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket , so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name!! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money!! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place. It would hurt Southwest in no way, shape or form to simply return the flight credit back to me. They still get the $711 revenue. The paper trail is there. They can clearly see the mistake of the duplicate ticket and they obviously know how their 'rules' twist this mistake all around to cheat me out of $711. I will never fly Southwest again!! Buyer beware!!"
"We made sure that we are on the correct gate according to the screens. Turns out that the screens were incorrect and the speakers didn’t work. A Southwest Airlines lady claimed that she told the group waiting here to switch gates. We were sitting there the whole time (for 1,5 h) and the information didn’t reach us. They weren’t also calling our names before closing the gate.Getting a refund was also tricky because they claimed it was our fault. Luckily I took a picture of the incorrect screen during departure time.I got vouchers and was forced to use southwest airlines once more. The vouchers didn’t cover the tax, so I had to pay 50$ none the less. I selected business class and oh boy it didn’t made a huge difference.. I had access to slow internet during he flight and I got a free drink voucher. I asked for a hot chocolate but it turns out that the drink had to be alcoholic (stupid, what if I’m pregnant?). So I ordered a beer and wanted to take it home. Before I was leaving a stewardess took the unopened can from me.. saying she has to, sooorry. The kid next to me was allowed to take the snacks home.I will never fly with Southwest Airlines again. Worst experience ever.PS: they also damaged my suitcase."
Customer service and Airline employees were the best! Very organized boarding procedures. And they don't nickel and dime you to death like some we can mention. Stress and hassle-free flying.
Usually great service and staff that enjoy their jobs. Great value!
never was bad to me
"Southwest airlines are awful and I never want to book with them again.  I booked tickets 3 months ago, missed my flight and they cancelled my flight back with no refund.  My flight hasn't even happened yet.  I told them I want to book the flight out again and they want me to pay for my flight I've already bought and then maybe I could get a refund!!!  The flight hasn't even happened yet!"
2 flights with SW on Sept 18th and Sept 22nd respectively. Both flights were delyed by more than 2 hours due to mechanical problems. The last delay made us miss our flight to Copenhagen. No support or assistance from SW.
"I got a vouchers for lost baggage and tried to apply it to a new ticket. Southwest online system confirmed the validity of the voucher, but failed to apply it to new ticket. Many calls to customer service, still cannot use that voucher. Avoid Southwest by all means"
"We were delayed four hours (and it may be more) due to a bird strike and I had to scramble to make arrangements for my son, which was almost not possible and extremely stressful. There have been five gate changes for other flights near our gates, so there is clearly a huge amount of disorganization. The bathroom was disgusting and had feces on the rim of the toilet.I understand that things happen, like bird strikes. However, there should be a plan in place for these events to mitigate delays for these occurrences. I will most likely not ever fly southwest again. There are massive issues that need to be addressed and it is very unfortunate that your lack of planning and extreme disorganization has caused significant and unnecessary stress for my family."
"I am writing this review to talk about a concern about booking a flight in advance and being charged a standby fee. On Aug 16, I booked a flight with Southwest Airlines under reservation #4tcehq. My booking included a return flight, but I encountered an issue that led to an unexpected fee due to my return flight being placed on standby. On my day of departure, I confirmed my flight from MCO, only to discover that my flight was on standby and subject to an additional fee. I was not informed of the standby status or the associated fee before this confirmation, which created an inconvenience and an unexpected expense to me. i spoke with a supervisor named Dennis who was very rude and hung up the phone on me. I will never fly this airline again."
"During the Holidays of 2022, I relocated across country, booked a trip home during  xmas shutdown at work, (NOT FLEXABLE)  flights were canceled for 5 day, by return could not be changed, therfore I had 1.5 days home with family.   Received 800 dollars in fight vouchers, but (still unpacking, not flying) they all expired, I asked for extension, denied.   DONE Flying Southwest Airlines For Life."
"I’ve been a southwest customer for over 40 years. In the early days, I loved traveling with them. They had low fares and interesting facing seats. As they grew so did their bureaucracy. When Herb retired, I knew the airline would go down hill… as it has. They are no different from American or Delta now. Old crotchety flight attendants"
"Our flight was scheduled to leave Las Vegas at 2:55 PM. With no announcements in the gate area, the flight was quietly delayed to 3:15 PM, then 3:50 PM, then 4:15 PM, then 4:55 PM. Even as I write this review, there still has not been an official reason given for the delay. We have been told as passengers that we will “get to our destination, as soon as we can“. I find this insufficient. With corporate executives making millions of dollars just last year and flying around on their own private planes, they are not (and will never be) subjected to the shocking levels of inconvenience and stress caused by aircraft delays. Many that are stuck here with me are missing important family events, or connecting flights. The contempt shown for passengers who paid them good money (and who are responsible for their rise to a nationally recognized airline) is amazing. I have flown Southwest for 16 years, and this flight will be my absolute last. If there is anyway possible to avoid using Southwest airlines, I would encourage readers to do so."
"I've flown 3 times this year on Southwest and at each interval I have had a great experience, even when things went wrong. During my most recent flight my app wasn't letting me display the boarding pass, but the counter agent remedied that immediately with a printed ticket.I called in on a few occasions to have an agent book my flight and I didn't wait a long time. They were helpful and informative. The flights were from Long Beach Airport and Sacramento and at each location it was easy to board/deplane. The prices are well within reason and the process to book is very simple."
Southwest discriminate against me because I have a disability.
Sitting in Tampa for 6 hours trying to get home. Flight got delayed 3 times before cancelling it at 9:30pm. Southwest denied any compensation or hotel rooms. Worst experience I could’ve asked for this trip.
Just called Southwest Customer Service because I noticed I transposed two letters of my wife's name on the reservation and couldn't figure out why the app or website wouldn't let me correct it.  It cost $75 for them to correct it which is ridiculous and took me 30 minutes.  That is straight up criminal for an error I noticed on a reservation that doesn't take place for 2 months.
"Lauren was my flight attendant for austin to Vegas. I rang the bell to ask for a snack earlier than before end of flight. Instead of a simple no. She said ""you didn't see the food before the plane?""Of course I did I just needed to board the plane on time.Said if I ring the bell one more time ""we're done""Woah.They train their people to have superiority complex issues"
Southwest rep just told me that purchasing earlybird doesn't automatically guarantee an A position and if you change your flight ypu give up earlybird yet I never saw a reimbursement since airfare was paid for in April. I signed up for earlybird and SOUTHWEST changed my flight. My boarding pass showed no earlybird yet my original ticket shows earlybird. No refund for either flight
"Every time, without fail, this airline is at LEAST 30 minutes late. I avoid this crappy airline if I can but unfortunately sometimes I have  to take a one way because the return time I want isn’t available on better, less crappy airlines. I’d almost rather not travel at all than sit on this cattle car and bake because the AC sucks while you are sitting, waiting. Pay for business class but why? Still packed airplanes with zero leg room and no arm room. So frustrating."
"I am 47 years old and a frequent flyer on Southwest. I have never encountered this kind of customer service on any airline before in my life.Barry is the name of the flight attendant that yelled at my 3 yr old daughter. She was sitting at the window seat. I was sitting in the aisle seat and my wife was in between us.I woke up to Barry leaning over me with his head right in front of my face yelling forcefully and directly to my 3 yr old daughter. My wife was in shock and froze.My daughter had put some decorative children’s tape on the window and seat in front of her. It peels off very easily. It’s one of several plane activities my wife had prepared for our young daughter. We removed the tape immediately.I don’t mind Barry asking me to remove the children’s tape or for my daughter not to put children’s decorative tape on the window and seat but his tone was intimidating and scary. His aggression toward my 3 yr old daughter was uncalled for, rude, and embarrassing. He is a loose canyon.I could hear others around me talking about how he acted and I decided to try and say something to him.Next time he came around, I politely tried to suggest to him that he did not need to use that tone with my 3 yr old daughter. He immediately snapped cutting me off and said something like, “if you don’t like it, write a letter to Southwest”. I couldn’t believe it.I had tried to ask him nicely and he was doubling down. He continued, “this is not your property, if you think it is ok to deface someone else’s property, then write a letter to Southwest”.I was calm and was trying to talk to him discreetly, but he was loud and made a scene.I said, “I didn’t say anything about WHAT you said, I’m talking about ‘how’ you said it”. He did not seem to understand the distinction.He said, “I don’t have time for this. If you have a problem with what I said, write a letter to Southwest”It was a very unpleasant experience and I hope no one else has to go through that."
"I arrived in Orlando 2 hours early for my flight to Columbus. Was told at desk since I was more than an hour early I had to leave my bags with an overweight young lad with his shirt out and a F you attitude. I put my golf bag on a cart , he took my suitcase and threw it on the floor inside a room. Upon arrival in Columbus, I got my golf bag but not my suitcase. Along with 27 others who were missing luggage. We were told by the baggage people to fill out a form and when the luggage arrived we could either pick it up (along with a $300 certificate) or they would bring it to us THAT NIGHT. I live 2 hours away. I chose for them to deliver it. When they called and said they had it, and confirmed my address (which I had already done with their worthless online app), I was told I was outside their delivery area and I could either come pick it up or they’d have Fed Ex deliver in three days. I’m working next three days so I can’t go get it. Half the clothes I have are in that suitcase. I have one appropriate outfit to wear the next three days to work. It was not my fault they missed 28 bags (probably due to that young boys lackadaisical attitude. Their customer service sucks"
"They apparently are counting small fanny packs now. I suppose it makes sense since I heard they plan to start counting neck pillows. Soon they will probably start limiting people to one bag total. Flight staff are inconsistent. Some of them are helpful, others will nitpick you."
"We were traveling from Pittsburgh to Baltimore, then connecting to Raleigh Durham.  Flight 1714, July 11, 2024, Boarding at 12:50 PM.   My husband and I are seniors I'm 79, he's 83.  I have COPD.  The Customer Service Agent (Phyllis) saw my distress when I arrived at her desk, got me a wheelchair and got one for my husband too!  She was a sweetie, very attentive to our needs and a Hugh compliment to your Airline.  In my younger days I worked in hospitality and in fact, taught customer service in several hotels from Pittsburgh to Washington DC.  Please reward this sweet lady, she's an asset to your Airline."
"The no assign seating practice is highly inappropriate. This is a country of selfish people who like their space. It makes no sense. Today takes the cake though. There were 2 empty seats back by the bathroom and they didn’t allow anyone to sit there on a very full plane. As someone traveling with their spouse and who uses the bathroom a lot; it sucks. You can screen share or be with them. If the plane crashes you’re all alone even if you didn’t travel alone. Why even assign seats in the ticket if it’s total bs. People aren’t kind to move and flight attended aren’t gonna play that game. Everything else about southwest is pretty dope; so to be fair I give 3 stars. Also, the snacks are peanut free but have multiple other of the top deadly allergies and they have the audacity to call it an allergy friendly snack. My allergies disagree as does the nutritional label (see ingredients list)."
"Overall, a descent airline all things considered- but then again travel isn’t what it use to be… in my most humble but accurate opinion, the enjoyment, the experience of flying to see family, or the excitement of taking a vacation to someplace where you’ve never been, is lacking. More like being a seat assignment than a passenger. And certainly cellphone phones have added significantly to the equation of making us a very impersonal society."
"I personally only fly Southwest.  I absolutely love them! As someone who is disabled they have made travel so much easier for me and their staff is so friendly and amazing.  I've never had an issue with Southwest and based on my experiences if I do, I'm sure they'll help figure out a solution.  My only suggestion is that BWI is fully redone inside.  It could use a people mover system for sure, but that's largely out of their control.   Their operations though out of Rochester, NY are superb as are their operations out of Orlando and BWI."
"If I could give Southwest Airlines no stars I would. After a recent trip to Vail Colorado for my son’s wedding  my flight home to Charleston was a nightmare. After boarding the plane a medical supervisor told us we had to deplane ,holding up the rest of the plane, as my husband told the check in person that  he had some altitude sickness in Vail. He was fine in Denver and felt fine on the plane. After quite the embarrassment,they made us leave and said we could be checked out by their EMT.  The EMT determined  my husband was fine but they still wouldn’t let us back on the plane. After kicking us off the flight for no apparent reason, they didn’t  even offer to help rebook and let us stay at the airport for a day and a half to get home to Charleston without any assistance. If they thought my husband was so sick so he couldn’t fly, which was not the case,they should’ve been more sympathetic and helpful. Poor everything!"
If I could leave less then 1 star I would.  My experience has been poor from start to finish twice I have been delayed.  One delay was long they caused me to miss my connection flight.  They didn't even bother assisting me with finding a new flight until I went to the customer service booth. The 2nd time they ask us to line up to board and then tell us to sit....the pilot called out.  I will never book with this airline ever again.  I have been treated as if I bought my ticket from a bargain basement sale
"The 1135 Southwest flight from Cancun ti Atlanta was significantly delayed. Fortunately we were met with an understanding, courteous, and professional crew of flight attendants that served us with polite responses to the delays, emphathtic engagement about the delays, and went beyond the call of duty to provide updates about connecting flights that were on time, gone, or delayed.  The fact that they even provided instructions to assist the passengers with missed connections was just an amazing act of kindness.   Some customers were very rude about the delays and but your team of flight attendants met their negativity with professional grace and positivity while explaining the delays to the best if their abilitity.  The level of humor, engagement, quality service, professionalism, and empathy was wonderful.  Please celebrate and congratulate the following crew for an AMAZING job done:  Celestine Armstead, Derric Allen Rogers, and Phillip Jefferey Sorel!  Please donʼt forget the pilot team as well:  Captain Leon Boyd Newman Jr. and Flight Officer Christian Winford Barnes!  Thanks again for an excellent job done in the mist of a difficult situation that was out of their control.  I Love Southwest!"
"Southwest Airlines is the best airline. We recently experienced a maintenance issue during one of our connecting flights. However, the Southwest staff handled the situation with exceptional professionalism and provided us with an alternate plane. To our surprise, we received an email this morning informing us that they would be sending a voucher as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience, without us even having to request it. This is a prime example of how a business should operate. I am grateful that I chose Southwest Airlines and will continue to choose them in the future because they truly deserve it."
The flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix was beautiful and have no complaints there. But at Sky Harbor airport at Baggage Claim my suitcase is purple and it's a plastic one with a pink name tag. Also the zipper that you can open to expand doesn't zip all the way. So I saw my suitcase and grabbed it bc of those identifiers. About 20 minutes later southwest representative calls me and said I had the wrong suitcase and of course I was so embarrassed and my step dad takes me back to the airport we were 20 minutes away. I get there and was apologizing a lot. The one Southwest employee a black woman went off on me and I was blown away. It was uncalled for and she was about to be recorded. So then I explained to the male employee what through me off and he agreed when be looked at the suitcases side by side that zipper was like mine and the pink tag like mineYes I should have looked at my name and I learned a lesson from it. And the person who the suitcase belong to was so ignorant I understood she was upset I would be also. However when I'm apologizing and I legit felt bad the least she could have done was acknowledge that. And your employee yelling at me in front of people was the most disgusting way to treat people in that line of work. I'm 52 yrs old and worked in customer service my adult life and I have never treated anyone like that. I could give her a pass if i was ignorant to her. It's not like I was in the plane to another state I was 20 minutes away and I never touched the suitcase from putting it in the car. I landed at 7:05 pm from Pittsburgh to Sky harbor on Flight 3466. My name is Michelle Strachan and the black woman who is a southwest employee that yelled at me like a child in front of people should be dealt with because she will cause that airline more problems without a doubt. And it was a honest mistake that I felt bad about and please pay attention when a customer  goes through something like that and is it in your policy to Tell your employees to yell at another adult who is not being disrespectful at all that it's acceptable that they act that way. I didn't record her but I almost did and it would have big a huge headache for your damage control team.
"I was coming home from Reagan International airport to St Louis on flight 4670, the landing was the most horrible experience I have ever had with ANY airlines. I really thought we weren’t going to make it, the worst flight ever!!!I have been traveling with Southwest for years…. I should probably change."
"we flew for the first time and they ruined my luggage. the lady at the baggage dept told us to scan the bar code but never said you have 4 hrs. go to website big issues so had to have nice lady file for us told us they are good at taken care of this issue. send all the info pictures and receipt. Now told nope not paying cause you only had 4 hrs. so this is now they treat customers. Will never Fly them again. they do owe me for destroying my suitcase, it to top it off the lady who works for them said happens all the time and you shouldn't buy that kind cause it doesn't expand wasn't that nice of her.jamie"
This airline is BROKEN and I hope Elliot Management can turn it around.  Please stop trying with the folksy inflight service attempts and just fix your planes and upgrade your maintenance problems  #lasvegas #5022 #abq
"I would like to take out this time to thank Michele Peebles for being so diligent and calling my family back in regards to my mom‘s walker that she left at the airport the service was outstanding, and hopefully this reaches the right individual to give her her recognition of representing the company very well. This just goes to show they’re still good people out there and we definitely appreciate your services. Hopefully you have a great and bless day and thanks once again for being who you are a genuine kindhearted person we wish you all the best and keep doing what you’re doing and that’s being great"
Honestly all the flights I have been on this year (5+) have been delayed and I am pretty tired of them not knowing why/doing anything to fix it. Sure you get baggage check for free but at 2hrs delay not worth it. The quality has plummeted. I cannot wait for the new law to come into affect because Southwest will owe their customers millions. About time they had someone keep them accountable.
"Southwest Hotels provided the worst, most botched up hotel reservation experience of my life, and I'm a 63-yr-old frequent traveler, so that takes some doing!In mid-March booked a hotel stay  for 5 nights in June in Orange County. Received confirmation of the booking by Southwest, who was usin Agoda search engine. All seemed fine; Southwest even emailed me about the upcoming stay more than once to make sure I was organized. Then, we arrive on the day, and there is no booking in the hotel's system. An hour on the phone in the hotel lobby (mostly on hold) with Southwest Concierge, and finally they tell me they had a problem getting the payment that was successfully charged to my credit card in March to the hotel.No attempt to contact me. No attempt to fix it and find me another hotel. No offer of points for my trouble or.to compensate me in any way for the stress and inconvenience they caused me and my partner. Just s lame apology from the poor sap at the call center and an ""offer"" to refund me the money charged to my credit card in March in 7-10 business days.Southwest needs to GET OUT of the business of hotel booking, as a look in google shows their performance is horrendously bad. I will never use this joke of a service again, and neither should anyone who wants to be able to trust that their hitel confirmation actually IS a confirmation without having to follow up behind the booking agency.For your peace of mind, I recommend you AVOID SOUTHWEST HOTELS ENTIRELY and Use Booking.com instead. That's who I turned to to secure a hotel stay at the last minute. I've used them dozens of times with no issues like this. Until Southwest Hotels can get its act together, it is likely to cause you grief."
I have almost always had great experience with Southwest Airlines. Great rewards program. Good flight experiences (except for weather delays that affect all airlines). Lack of extra fees for flight changes and baggage. Friendly staff.A couple of caveats: They never seem to have direct flights to anywhere I want to go. The Internet is often down. Business select doesn't offer much if you don't want a free drink. Early boarding (low A's) doesn't mean as much if there are so many preboarders.
"This airline is quite straightforward, you know what you will pay and there are no hidden fees. Plus the 2 checked in luggage pieces are an advantage"
"THE WORSE RAPID REWARDS PROGRAM FOR HOTELS! they are deceitful. They are liars. They told me I would get a refund for a hotel if the hotel would accept the refund. Hotel accepted. Got them both on the same line. They completely lied. Daniela is the supervisor- truly worse customer service rep I have ever encountered. She is not a problem solver, has no customer service etiquette.  I have a SW airlines credit card I will be canceling. I will no longer be flying or using miles on SW airlines. the WORST"
It’s not just one time! It’s multiple times and occasions I’ve been stuck dealing with bad service from southwest: I’m currently on a flight now that hasn’t taken off because some unknown occurrence. This stuff is terrible and it’s time for change! I mean for myself! I’m on my way to never flying southwest again. Never should my American dollars be used to help fund another person agenda at the cost of my happiness. 🖕🏽🖕🏽 southwest
It’s hit and miss on flight experience. Some attendants are rude. DO NOT purchase their internet. It is the worst. All other airlines are better. They are always in the crappiest parts of airports. I reached out to customer service on the plane and told to contact customer service. It was their online customer service. I was on the plane and I told them. I basically got “too bad.”  Thank god my company is moving towards Delta.
"I fly from Las Vegas to Long Beach very frequently in the last two times I’ve flown I’ve try to sit by the window and people say that the seat is reserved.  I’m like, can passengers do that?  I’m in the flight right now and it happened again.  I believe is open seat.  Not to reserve.  Thank you for listening"
If you get a text stating your flight is delayed...IGNORE IT since they can still board and leave at the original time.  They claim the text is a courtesy notice to leave you stranded which happened to my husbands flight today from Tampa to Denver...text said flt 1110 was departing at 1:38pm instead of 11:40am...it left at 12:04pm.
"Fly them all the time.  Flying today and the flight attendant forced me to remove my bag from the overhead for someone whos bag was too big to fit under the seat.  The person came on late with 2 bags.  I had one, but they made mw move mine.  Im well over 6ft tall.and this left me with no leg room to stretch.  Usually I can stretch out with my legs under the seat in front of me but not today.  If thats how Southwest wants to treat loyal customers, I will fly someone else"
"I had things stolen from my checked baggage. I also don't like that they don't assign seats. You are put into a group and one group at a time goes on the plane and you can sit where you want. I paid for business select and didn't get a good seat. I paid $125 to get upgraded and it was for nothing. Also, one of the luggage check-in guys was very rude to me and I only asked a reasonable question. I will NEVER fly this airline again."
"We have been flying Southwest Air for many years.  Well, yesterday on Flight 1571 from LAX to BWI, we experienced the worse flight of our life.  There was an older Flight Attendant that was not allowing people to get to the bathroom, she tossed snacks at you, and yelled loudly at an elderly gentleman.  The Lead Flight Attendant told us that WiFi would not be available on our flight.  For almost five (5) hours, we listened at crying, loud babies and kids.  My Husband called today to complain about the problems and was pretty much blown off by another older sounding woman at their Corporate Office.  Their flights are now full, the bottom of the seat is thin and if you are sitting in front of a child, you could be kicked in your back the entire flight—my experience.  No longer recommended!"
"I missed my flight due to auto problems, then when I got to the airport, the agent booked me for the next flight. Except she didn't book my second leg, or my return flights, and didn't tell me. At the gate I asked the gate agent about my connecting flight and the guy said I didn't have one. So he booked that for me, but didn't book a return flight, and he didn't tell me that. I guess, stupid me, I assumed those jerks would know I have to get back home and paid for a round trip fare. A couple days later when I didn't see a ""check in"" email for my return flight. I called and they said I didn't have a return flight and would have to pay another $198 to fly back. So I got double charged for the exact same flight because two agents screwed up. Their customer service/complaints people basically told me to go pound sand, it's just policy. What crap. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, and I fly a ton. That's it for southwest. I'm taking my business elsewhere."
"Southwest has always been my go to airlines. Being wheelchair bound disabled, no airlines has done such a outstanding job as Southwest. They've always treated me with upmost respect, helping me from my chair into my seat and folding my power wheelchair down so it can be loaded into the belly of the plane. Of all my locations, the staff that handles luggage, has taken great care of my wheelchair as it weighs 65 lbs. I can't express my gratitude enough for all they do."
SWA has a number of good features like low prices - we do not pay for upgrade to sit closer to the front - and SWA does not charge for checked bags. Changes/transfers are easy and don't cost too much if you get the upgrade. I have the Rapid Rewards credit card that earns points with everything you purchased. My round-trip flight from KC to Philadelphia was purchased with points.
"Worst airline. I made the mistake of paying double for their “ business class.” What a huge mistake. I thought I was treating myself but unfortunately about 30% pre boarded and took all of the premium rows. So even being A3, I was far back, crappy uncomfortable seats.Pro tip, fake a handicap and you can get the  perimeter seats for no extra charge."
"On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request.The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience.I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies.I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience. I will be choosing American Airlines for future travel."
"TSA randomly selects people for a secondary screening at the gate, which is out of all airlines control. However, with most airlines assigned seating, this only affects the flight you are selected for the screening for and doesn’t affect your boarding. With Southwest’s check in and reservation system, getting selected for secondary screening means you are in for major issues. Southwest’s well rehearsed response by phone support, check in personnel and gate agents, for the multiple impacts, is that it is not our fault’. That you were selected by the TSA, not Southwest, so you get nothing from Southwest to help rectify the situation of getting a late C group number when you went to all the trouble to check in and your spouse on the same reservation gets A group.It is true that it is TSA for being selected for the extra secondary security screening for the first flight. However, all the issues on subsequent connecting fights are caused by Southwest's reservation system and boarding process. There is no reason not to get assigned your legitimate place in line on the rest of your connecting flights as the TSA screening has nothing to do with them. Even worse then not being able to board with the rest of your party on the reservation on subsequent flights, is losing your TSA Pre Check from paying for Global Entry on the rest of your connecting flights. On international flights you usually need to go through security again after clearing customs. On my recent trip back from Mexico, the rest of my party with TSA Pre Check cleared security in 5 minutes and then waited another 50 minutes for me to finally show up. This is very much Southwest's issue. Other airlines with different reservation systems have none of these issues.There are things that Southwest could have and should have done on my connecting flight. I clearly should have had an A group number as all other folks on the reservation with me did. All the numbers are gone since the Southwest system would not assign my connecting flight boarding position since it wouldn’t assign the 1st flight. However, Southwest lets ""special circumstance"" folks board after the A group, before the B group. When I asked the gate agent in Miami, Monica V., if there was anything I could do to board at least close to the rest of my party, she parroted the party line that is was TSA’s fault and that there was nothing she could do. When I mentioned boarding after the A’s, she got that hostile look like I was just another low life trouble maker trying to cheat my way onto the plane before my turn. She stated that was ONLY for disabled passengers and my issue was not a Southwest problem.An even better solution is for Southwest to still issue you your boarding position number for your connecting flights and not remove TSA PRE from your connecting flight boarding pass"
"We have used Southwest a number of times and we have been very pleased with the service. We just got back from Panama city Florida and the service at check in all the way to boarding was seamless. The Southwest flight attendants are great! Can't go wrong with 1st bag free also. Personally, we like the choose your own seating once on board verses the assigned seating on other airlines."
I like this airline. I’ve flown with them multiple times last year. I mistakenly flew with United last week. Their app isn’t work and they don’t include carryon in the ticket price. United airlines is such a scam and I missed the service and ease of southwest. Just wanted to say I appreciate an easy and smooth experience.
"I need to cancel a flight due to Covid travel restrictions.  I was given a travel voucher but unable to re-book withing one year, again due to Covid travel restrictions.  Southwest refuses to honor my voucher.  They just took my money and will not work with me in way except to say sorry we are keeping your money."
"Onboard SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight from Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale, just as the door closed to leave, I was assaulted by the Flight Attendant. As I was saying goodbye to my husband on my phone, a male flight attendant leaned past two passengers to jab his fingers into my shoulder. I was sitting in the window seat and suddenly felt pain in my shoulder from this male flight attendant's assault. I recently had rotator cuff surgery, and I was shocked that a man just poked me there. I am a 63 year old woman, and I pre-boarded due to disabilities. When I looked at him he said ""turn off your cell phone now"". The preparation announcements were just being made when this assault took place. As I said, I was telling my husband goodbye . With doors flying off, DEI hiring of pilots, and all the horrors of flying, I ALWAYS tell my husband I love him just before I take off. I did nothing wrong, and certainly, NO FLIGHT ATTENDANT HAS THE RIGHT TO JAB HIS HAND INTO ANYONE'S SHOULDER. Well, I contacted Southwest Airlines and they essentially called me a liar. (It took a month for a response from SWA) I provided them with full details and also a photograph of this flight attendant. Their delayed response was that the feedback of the crew member was that he did not recall. They quoted their policy: ""Once the entry doors are closed in preparation for pushback, cellular voice and data functions must be turned off"". So instead of being appalled and sorry for this assault, they implied somehow I did not know about turning off cell phones. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, yet NO ONE SHOULD BE physically assaulted by a flight attendant. SWA doesn't have the right to lay hands on a passenger. My complaint was completely blown off, and swept under the rug by SWA. They ended the correspondence by ""We hope you  will fly Southwest Airlines again and that your support and confidence is very important to us"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Why would I fly them again after they physically assaulted me? So after they assaulted a 63 year old woman with disabilities they took no responsibility, They we're very clear that somehow it was my fault that I was assaulted. Well, I am done flying SWA. There are better airlines that value their passengers and treat their passengers with respect."
"The day before our scheduled flight I checked in through the app. I called my wife to ask if she had checked in, but she was having difficulty w/the app. I called customer service. Within a few minutes the customer service rep had fixed the problem & even had her booked in a better group. SWA customer service doesn't always get the credit & positive recognition they deserve.In addition, when we were checking in for our flight, there was a line for 75 plus people. The local SWA employee in St. Louis had a great attitude & was so positive in all her interactions with all those trying to check in. Again, I just want to give credit & recognition to the many who do a great job every day. Thank you."
"I think many people only leave a review when they have something negative to say. I've flown on Southwest Airlines for 30 years without issues. I think they lost my bag once, but that happens with every airliner. The Southwest staff is SO MUCH friendlier than other airlines. Southwest's prices are often cheaper than others, too. I've had a few unfortunate situations with Southwest, but out of all other airliners, I've had the LEAST amount of issues with Southwest. Even when I call their main customer support line, the agents are understanding, courteous, and helpful. It's a reality that problems will occur in any business. I appreciate Southwest's importance on customer service. Definitely my favorite airline!"
"Our flight was canceled due to weather from Denver >Milwaukee. I made a mistake on how I booked our flight out. Which was over $740.00, but I was told to just call customer service & I’d get my money back. The next day when I called the I-FLY-SWA #  I told the representative the situation (3) timesShe replied all 3 times “we don’t refund for flights already taken” So thinking she was just having a rough day I hung up. I immediately called again and got a rep. 1. That listened to my situation, 2.put me on hold to ask what to do.  &  3. When she came back on, she said she understands the issue,& opened a claim report and SW would research the situation.YEAH, within 4 days I received a call that I would receive a full refund. And 2 weeks later I received all my money for the flight I booked unwittingly. KUDOS to Southwest for understanding and refunding my money. I know I didn’t follow prodigal but it is stressful when a flight is canceled, and I did what I thought was correct. but again SW thank youIt did cost me 1 nights stay in a hotel as Southwest does not pay for a room if weather related but that was minimal compared to the 747.00 flight.So despite the 1st.call, I STILL give SW a 5 STAR rating.! For knowing we are all human."
