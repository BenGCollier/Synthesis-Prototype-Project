Review
"Negative stars!  I had 4 flights for my family to get home extremely late.  I saw that they had a different one that worked to get us home earlier so I changed to that one for $575.  After getting to the airport, our new flight was delayed and now we will miss our connecting flight home.  They now have us on the original flight home because it's the only one and they won't refund me my 575 dollars that I paid when I changed my flight.  The lady at the kiosk was extremely rude, Joelene was her name.  She had no empathy and refused to take care of me after I called her on her rudeness.  She literally moved on to other customers and ignored me from there.  Delays happen, I get it but putting me back on my original flight home and keeping my 575 is a scam of all scams!!!  Don't use this garbage airline"
"Southwest Airlines is a great company and theONLY airline I will fly.  They are polite, considerate, affordable when compared to the others"
First and last time flying with this laires. They say that seat assignments are available 24 hours before the flight. Not a good experience.
Terrible.  Worst flight I’ve ever taken anywhere in the world.  Passenger next to me never put his seat belt on and the cabin crew did not ever check the cabin.  They were too taken up cracking childish jokes as though the whole flight was a joke to them.   Said passenger was also texting and receiving texts during landing.  Airline safety surely isn’t a joke?
My luggage was irreparably damaged by their baggage handlers whern I arrived at my destination.  I had a dent and a gauge or hole in my luggage. They said the dent was normal wear and tear but the hole was their liability. Do they gave me a voucher for $50 for a future flight. I took my luggage and the repair person said it was not repairable. I complained through Better Business Bureau and this time Southwest went back on their orginal statement and said this was normal wear and tear.  So I am out a lot of money for a new bag. Southwest does not really save you money for any money I saved on the flight will be spent on new luggage. I will never fly Southwest again. I had a similar incident a long time ago with Delta where they put an irreparable hole in my luggage and they paid me for a new bag. Delta maybe more expensive but they are at least honest.
"I have been a faithful customer of Southwest for years and have had mostly good experiences. I'm very disappointed, however, if the recent changes at Southwest - charging for baggage, reducing the length of time that flight credits can be used - I counted on these features. How I'll just start looking at Delta Airlines when I'm traveling."
"I had the worst experience flying with Southwest Airlines. My family of five travels together with one large luggage to keep things simple and convenient. However, on our return flight, they charged us an extra $200 because our luggage was exceeding the standard size by just 5 inches. This is absolutely ridiculous! We could have easily checked in 5 smaller bags, each included in the price, but that would have taken up more space in the compartment and added more weight — making this policy clearly about squeezing more money out of customers, not about space or weight. To make matters worse, we weren't charged this fee on the flight in, but only on the way out. They claimed they changed the policy during our vacation, which felt like a total scam. This is pure corporate greed! I will never fly with Southwest again. Avoid this airline at all costs — they are nothing but scammers and crooks!"
"This review is strictly my opinion.  My review is based upon changes that the airline has made, will make, or probable changes in the future.  SWA continues to devalue Rapid Rewards (as it has done time and time again) and has upcoming plans to further devalue.  They will begin implementing much less fair dynamic points pricing.  This will make their rewards program much less advantageous compared to other airlines.  SWA will begin checked-bag fees.  They have always been ahead of the pack in the past with no bag fees.  This will be going away.   Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA will start assigning seats (which implies charging for seats).  They are becoming their competitors, which is insanely unnecessary. Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Not only is SWA devaluing their reward points, they may also add expirations to points.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA may soon worsen flight credit expiration; which may naturally lead to charges for cancelled or changed flights.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Anticipated future changes are higher obstacles to acquire A-list, A-list preferred, and companion pass status; as well as reducing the perks and value.  SWA may even start charging for carry-on bags.  All of this makes them much less competitive and much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  I believe that they are repeatedly punching the guts of their long-time loyal customers.  None of their changes will inspire loyalty.  These changes will be quite advantageous to the other airlines as customers will be driven away into the waiting arms of the other carriers.  The leadership at SWA has landed themselves into positions that they don't belong in and have absolutely no business in.   It is obvious that SWA is trading long-term success and loyalty for short-term profits.  This is all both sad and maddening.  I hope that the majority share holders can smell the stink of all these changes and kick the current decision makers to the curb.  I wish you all luck with choosing other airlines."
I purchased EarlyBird Checkin for a total of $40 for one trip. I got B25. They claimed 70 people were ahead of me with priority of A-List and A-List Preferred. I don't believe this at all! This is a scummy airline. Now they're charging for bags when they used to brag about not charging and laugh at other airlines! I'll never fly them again and neither should you. They've gone downhill so fast!Every year since Robert Jordan was promoted to CEO in 2022 there has been a huge controversy. He is in WAY over his head and should be fired!!! He must go!
Trash airline that makes me give up my seat when I boarded first and now are charging for two bags. I have nothing good to say about this airline and I have been a loyal customer for years. They have lost my bags and treat their customers like garbage. Absolutely do not recommend
"Southwest Airlines has long prided itself on being different than other airlines: from free checked bags to open seating, many distinguishing factors led me as well as millions of other customers to choose Southwest. That era is sadly at an end. With the adoption of a “penny-wise, pound-foolish” approach, Southwest’s decision to end the aforementioned features will likely result in customers abandoning it for other airlines. I grew up using Southwest, as it is a “family-friendly” airline through the baggage and seating policy. Now, little is left policy-wise to distinguish it from any other airline and the “family-friendly” factor is lost. I highly doubt that I will hear the words “thank you for choosing Southwest” after a flight ever again after they have chosen to shift away from consumers and long-term reputation towards investors and short-term revenue prioritization."
HORRIBLE! Paid premium rates for my whole family to be priority A boarding and they let a whole bunch of people FAKING needing wheelchairs on the plane and my family and I were forced to sit far in the back despite paying premium prices where all the lying lifestyle fat people got to sit in the front seats and they all spread out since the flight wasn’t full so 1 fatty sat in a middle and they refused to move. The early “disabled” boarding should be forced  to the back of the plane.  If someone pays double or triple fare to guarantee front seats they should get their seats!! You lost this frequent flyer forever.
First and last time flying with this laires. They say that seat assignments are available 24 hours before the flight. Seat assignments are nowhere to be found.
Worst airline for seating - they have no policy to stop seat saving and the attendants are NO help.  I won't fly southwest again; worst experience flying in years!
"Flight cancelled and the rebooking flight is 12 hours later, have work the next day that im gonna have to miss yet they give no compensation or help for the great inconvinience that this caused. Greatly dissapointed"
"Wow, first time flying Southwest and never again. Their business far gives you nothing and then you add $150 for a bag that was 4lbs overweight made it more expensive than flying first class with a premium airline. Rude staff!"
I wouldn't fly with Southwest if it was free.  That's how bad it is.  The flight attendants are so abusive.  I received a credit due to the poor treatment I received but never used it.  Southwest is so bad I actually passed up a free flight.
"Deeply Disappointed - Unprofessional and Unhelpful StaffI am a frequent Southwest flyer, and while I generally appreciate the airline, the Oakland location stands out for all the wrong reasons. The staff here have consistently been the rudest, least helpful airline employees I have encountered--not just within Southwest, but across any airline l've flown.It is abundantly clear that many of them do not want to be there, and unfortunately, they take that frustration out on the very people they are paid to assist-the customers. Their attitude is not just indifferent; it's actively hostile. Rather than providing solutions, they seem determined to find any possible reason to make the travel experience more difficult, whether that means creating unnecessary issues with baggage or simply refusing to be accommodating in even the smallest ways. I have been to this location multiple times and this has been my experience every time.This starkly contrasts with my experiences at Burbank Airport, where the Southwest crew is consistently welcoming, professional, and genuinely helpful. It's disappointing that such a dramatic difference exists within the same airline.Southwest as a company should seriously reevaluate the customer service culture at its Oakland location, because right now, it's doing a disservice to both the airline's reputation and its loyal passengers."
I generally like Southwest.  However there’s some airline employees that simply are not intelligent.  First we are told that the upper storage is small.  I’ve brought the same bag a dozen times on various plane types but this is a MAX8.  It’s a newer plane and storage is more than ample and was designed that way!!!.  I know she’s wrong but I compact it even more.   She measures it and tells me I need to check it.  So while I know she’s a flaming idiot I comply because it is a commie process and they can decide if you fly or not.  I get on board after checking my bag.  Over the intercom they say that the bins are large.  Ok.  Which is it Southwest?  Shouldn’t the attendants know what the hell they are saying and doing?   Now I have a checked bag because we an have an idiot at the gate who is using an old baggage sizing for an old plane.  Some people just never figured out how to fit the square block in the square hole and are now controlling people that passed that test with flying colors!!!!  Please do something about these people because I’m slowly moving towards delta.   It’s way more convenient but not a direct flight…. It seems it may be worth it though especially when you go to assigned seating… I’m sitting here hating Southwest right now because I have to abide by rude controlling people that are less intelligent then me.
Do not waste your time or money booking with southwest cruises. The benefits they offer will not happen. I will never ever use this service again.
Open seating sucks. Boarding technique also horrible. No one checks line jumpers. No 1st class option. Zero premium anything here. Just one large overcrowded pushing and shoving compartment with the most uncomfortable seats of any airline. Fly another carrier if at all possible.
"I am usually reluctant to write reviews because consumer facing business is difficult. But Southwest Airlines is a miserable experience top to bottom, especially with all forms of phone support. Customer care treated me with extreme rudeness and then outright hostility when I was unable to change my password that appeared in a data breach of their services. Ultimately, after being yelled at I was hung up on. I called back and not one but two customer care reps were unable to find a record of the call or the email I was sent from their system. The website is a relic with subpar performance and security. No one seems to care. I can only assume this level of mediocrity extends to all services including the safety of air travel. Years ago, SW was a great company, but they are stuck in the past and it's reflected across the board. I can't say I'll never travel SW especially for short hops, but they will be the absolute last resort."
"First off I have over 100 thousand miles in the air with Delta in South African air so I should have book my flight with Delta but we went through a travel agent instead of doing it myself first mistake second mistake is accepting Southwest. The people are amazing No complaints there, but the company bought brand new planes and put an extra seat in them so now no room for a cart to go between the Aisle. The bathroom is so small that a big man like myself 6 foot tall 300 pounds barely fits in the bathroom and let me not even get on the seats I have marks on my back with the seatbelt rubbed my back from Vegas to Orlando airport. I never moved  I was afraid I wouldn’t get back in the chair. So my wife was in the middle of two 300 lbs men so at 117 lbs she did not enjoy her flight . I understand business trying to get the most people in a plane for the fuel cost but it $250 per person one way you would think they would think about the customer not their selves. Don’t worry I’ll never fly Southwest  again and I tell people Look at the reviews before you booking"
"It is ridiculous that Southwest allows a family of four to earn points together when they fly, but then they can’t book together when using the points and requires each family member including kids to book their own flight separately.  Seems like Southwest really needs to improve their policies and let a family with kids combine their points to book together on one account! Seems silly to make four family members all login separately to try to get flights. The points are becoming worthless.  Then, the kids each have separate flights not connected to the parents app and it becomes a problem. Hopefully Southwest sees this and fixes the issue to become more family, friendly!"
"Last Friday, a friend and I sought to change our return flight to Baltimore the following Monday, due to an anticipated snow storm. We were still in Baltimore when we tried to make the change, so we asked a staff member for help.  That staff member turned out to be a woman named Imani (#131603) and she was absolutely fantastic: understanding, efficient, kind, and effective.  The outcome was also perfect: We made it back without a hassle, safe and dry, and we didn't experience any of the weather delays that the storm caused the next day.  We are so grateful to Imani.  She was great!"
"My granddaughter is autistic and my daughter had a trip to Disney planned.  She wants to cancel her trip because my granddaughter's behavior flipped to agressive.  To save the the plane from being turned around or save the embarrassment of being kicked off the plane, she wants to cancel the trip.  Southwest will not refund her the money.She has saved for awhile for this trip.I think this is terrible.   Southwest is a bunch of greedy a** holes."
It is the worst airline I have ever experienced. The flight attendants are bad and rule the plane. We were not seated when we booked tickets for three together. they paid no attention to customer service. I have traveled across the world and this airline has just appointed me so badly. I would never again book Southwest Airlines even at the lowest price.This airline is worth a penny.
"I arrived in St. Louis from San Francisco ON 12/16/24. Upon arrival notified that final flight going to DFW was delayed. Then informed again flight was delayed as plane needed a part to continue. Young lady at ticket counter could barely speak as she had a face mask on and did not know how to use microphone. After an hour and asking questions, informed gate was switched from E16 to E36. Another ticket agent at this counter was very rude and disrespectful to elderly people in wheelchairs asking questions. What is the purpose of customer service if a ticket agent hates doing their job and takes their negative energy to others? Has this company forgotten what brought them customers? This was flight 1268 from St. Louis to Dallas. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FLYING SOUTHWEST OUT OF SAINT LOUIS!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS."
Flight #3834 on Sunday (Dec 15th).  The flight is over 1 hour and a half delayed and we are all boarded the flight and frustrated that we are still not moving.  Flight attendants are laughing and having fun and showing zero empathy for the passengers who have been delayed over 1 hour and half.  We are all just sitting in our seats waiting to depart and the flight attendants are joking around and laughing while we are all waiting to depart.  Poor example of not reading the crowd by the Flight Attendants.  Show some empathy.
They want to gouge customers when changing flight times. Its just insane how they treat you and want to squeeze every last dime out of you. Another airline on its way out.
"I recently experienced what I consider to be terrible customer service from every level of customer service from checkin to boarding of the aircraft. I was flying from Las Vegas to Boise and it was a Saturday early evening. I tried to checkin at the counter downstairs where the lady waved me over and then said, Go check in at the self checkin. I had questions, but she wouldn't help, she said, you dont have bags so go checkin at self checkout.  I was taken back by her rudeness, and there was nobody ahead of me or behind me. Then, I get upstairs and am trying to get through to my gate, and the information on my boarding pass didnt match my gate information. The individuals at gates C11 C12 & C14 would not help, to busy talking amongst themselves to help. Once again, terrible customer service. Then prior to boarding, the Southwest Airline attendant allowed families with dogs to go first, not disabled, veterans or people needing extra time. This is crazy! I had pre boarding but, I could barely get to the counter because his lack of controlling people around his desk area. When trying to scan my boarding pass, it was not working, so the attendant grabbed my phone and slammed it on the scanner. I am not impressed by the rudeness, the lack of customer service and disrespect to myself and my property. If you hate the job, find a new one, because the service and unhelpful attitudes does nothing for your sinking airline!"
"When attempting to update my trip (Wanna Get Away Plus) from Sunday flight to a Saturday flight, I was able to select 2 seats for $523 using the app. However, the app does not allow you to update a reservation when you have a lap child (a very ridiculous restriction).I immediately called southwest, and they informed me the tickets were now $840. I expressed how I could see the tickets on the app (even after refreshing) and after 20 mins, was able to get the agent to split my reservation so my wife's ticket was $523 and my ticket was $840. They were unable to honor the price I should have received if the app had just worked. Further, the agent was not able to come up with this solution - I had to suggest it in order to reduce my additional cost from $700 and something to $380.Overall, I am very disappointed in southwest and hope they can resolve this issue."
"I would've not even rated the service a 1 star. We are disappointed as a company to learn that we are not able to transfer flight credit for other employers when traveling due to travel change. We will not receive a refund, and the flight credit is useless. We have spent so much money using Southwest Airlines and now our company will never use this travel airline ever.Company out there that uses Southwest for travel I warn you now not to book. If you have any last-minute emergency or changes to your employee travel, you're wasting money!!"
"Southwest Airlines flight on 11/21 at 5:45 AM from Tulsa to St. Louis.Pilots were late for first flight of the day, delaying departure.Crew announced there would be no beverage service due to turbulence.One of the smoothest flights one could have taken.Very unexpected and dissappointing from an airline that had been known for wowing customers with great service,"
Watch the early-bird check-in as it says guaranteed A1-A15 boarding we ended up with A60 and B1. Might as well have taken our chances and saved some money.
"This airline is amazing! It had complimentary drinks and water! The seats were comfy, and the leg room was spectacular. 10/10, would recommend!"
"I want to give a big thank you to Onnie, the flight attendant on Southwest Flight #2913 from Chicago Midway to Cincinnati on October 28, 2024. His patience and kindness, especially with a mother and her young child, truly stood out. He went out of his way to make their flight smoother and more comfortable. The Non-GMO snacks were a nice touch too! It was a wonderful experience, and we’ll definitely be flying Southwest again."
"One of the best airlines for me at least, never had a problem with the airline, always had the best experience with southwest."
"I love your direct comment to Boeing this week; The CEOs of Southwest Airlines and American Airlines both want Boeing to deliver planes on time.Too bad our flight from Costa Rica wasn't on time and we had to stay overnight in Houston with a little over $500.00 in expenses that was denied by your company since it wasn't your fault!! Nothing compared to the $6.1 billion dollars Boeing is losing but to hard-working people it goes a long way. American Airlines, Delta, JSX....any one except Southwest will get our money for flights next time."
"On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertantly gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket , so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name!! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money!! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place. It would hurt Southwest in no way, shape or form to simply return the flight credit back to me. They still get the $711 revenue. The paper trail is there. They can clearly see the mistake of the duplicate ticket and they obviously know how their 'rules' twist this mistake all around to cheat me out of $711. I will never fly Southwest again!! Buyer beware!!"
"We made sure that we are on the correct gate according to the screens. Turns out that the screens were incorrect and the speakers didn’t work. A Southwest Airlines lady claimed that she told the group waiting here to switch gates. We were sitting there the whole time (for 1,5 h) and the information didn’t reach us. They weren’t also calling our names before closing the gate.Getting a refund was also tricky because they claimed it was our fault. Luckily I took a picture of the incorrect screen during departure time.I got vouchers and was forced to use southwest airlines once more. The vouchers didn’t cover the tax, so I had to pay 50$ none the less. I selected business class and oh boy it didn’t made a huge difference.. I had access to slow internet during he flight and I got a free drink voucher. I asked for a hot chocolate but it turns out that the drink had to be alcoholic (stupid, what if I’m pregnant?). So I ordered a beer and wanted to take it home. Before I was leaving a stewardess took the unopened can from me.. saying she has to, sooorry. The kid next to me was allowed to take the snacks home.I will never fly with Southwest Airlines again. Worst experience ever.PS: they also damaged my suitcase."
Customer service and Airline employees were the best! Very organized boarding procedures. And they don't nickel and dime you to death like some we can mention. Stress and hassle-free flying.
Usually great service and staff that enjoy their jobs. Great value!
never was bad to me
"Southwest airlines are awful and I never want to book with them again.  I booked tickets 3 months ago, missed my flight and they cancelled my flight back with no refund.  My flight hasn't even happened yet.  I told them I want to book the flight out again and they want me to pay for my flight I've already bought and then maybe I could get a refund!!!  The flight hasn't even happened yet!"
2 flights with SW on Sept 18th and Sept 22nd respectively. Both flights were delyed by more than 2 hours due to mechanical problems. The last delay made us miss our flight to Copenhagen. No support or assistance from SW.
"I got a vouchers for lost baggage and tried to apply it to a new ticket. Southwest online system confirmed the validity of the voucher, but failed to apply it to new ticket. Many calls to customer service, still cannot use that voucher. Avoid Southwest by all means"
"We were delayed four hours (and it may be more) due to a bird strike and I had to scramble to make arrangements for my son, which was almost not possible and extremely stressful. There have been five gate changes for other flights near our gates, so there is clearly a huge amount of disorganization. The bathroom was disgusting and had feces on the rim of the toilet.I understand that things happen, like bird strikes. However, there should be a plan in place for these events to mitigate delays for these occurrences. I will most likely not ever fly southwest again. There are massive issues that need to be addressed and it is very unfortunate that your lack of planning and extreme disorganization has caused significant and unnecessary stress for my family."
"I am writing this review to talk about a concern about booking a flight in advance and being charged a standby fee. On Aug 16, I booked a flight with Southwest Airlines under reservation #4tcehq. My booking included a return flight, but I encountered an issue that led to an unexpected fee due to my return flight being placed on standby. On my day of departure, I confirmed my flight from MCO, only to discover that my flight was on standby and subject to an additional fee. I was not informed of the standby status or the associated fee before this confirmation, which created an inconvenience and an unexpected expense to me. i spoke with a supervisor named Dennis who was very rude and hung up the phone on me. I will never fly this airline again."
"During the Holidays of 2022, I relocated across country, booked a trip home during  xmas shutdown at work, (NOT FLEXABLE)  flights were canceled for 5 day, by return could not be changed, therfore I had 1.5 days home with family.   Received 800 dollars in fight vouchers, but (still unpacking, not flying) they all expired, I asked for extension, denied.   DONE Flying Southwest Airlines For Life."
"I’ve been a southwest customer for over 40 years. In the early days, I loved traveling with them. They had low fares and interesting facing seats. As they grew so did their bureaucracy. When Herb retired, I knew the airline would go down hill… as it has. They are no different from American or Delta now. Old crotchety flight attendants"
"Our flight was scheduled to leave Las Vegas at 2:55 PM. With no announcements in the gate area, the flight was quietly delayed to 3:15 PM, then 3:50 PM, then 4:15 PM, then 4:55 PM. Even as I write this review, there still has not been an official reason given for the delay. We have been told as passengers that we will “get to our destination, as soon as we can“. I find this insufficient. With corporate executives making millions of dollars just last year and flying around on their own private planes, they are not (and will never be) subjected to the shocking levels of inconvenience and stress caused by aircraft delays. Many that are stuck here with me are missing important family events, or connecting flights. The contempt shown for passengers who paid them good money (and who are responsible for their rise to a nationally recognized airline) is amazing. I have flown Southwest for 16 years, and this flight will be my absolute last. If there is anyway possible to avoid using Southwest airlines, I would encourage readers to do so."
"I've flown 3 times this year on Southwest and at each interval I have had a great experience, even when things went wrong. During my most recent flight my app wasn't letting me display the boarding pass, but the counter agent remedied that immediately with a printed ticket.I called in on a few occasions to have an agent book my flight and I didn't wait a long time. They were helpful and informative. The flights were from Long Beach Airport and Sacramento and at each location it was easy to board/deplane. The prices are well within reason and the process to book is very simple."
Southwest discriminate against me because I have a disability.
Sitting in Tampa for 6 hours trying to get home. Flight got delayed 3 times before cancelling it at 9:30pm. Southwest denied any compensation or hotel rooms. Worst experience I could’ve asked for this trip.
Just called Southwest Customer Service because I noticed I transposed two letters of my wife's name on the reservation and couldn't figure out why the app or website wouldn't let me correct it.  It cost $75 for them to correct it which is ridiculous and took me 30 minutes.  That is straight up criminal for an error I noticed on a reservation that doesn't take place for 2 months.
"Lauren was my flight attendant for austin to Vegas. I rang the bell to ask for a snack earlier than before end of flight. Instead of a simple no. She said ""you didn't see the food before the plane?""Of course I did I just needed to board the plane on time.Said if I ring the bell one more time ""we're done""Woah.They train their people to have superiority complex issues"
Southwest rep just told me that purchasing earlybird doesn't automatically guarantee an A position and if you change your flight ypu give up earlybird yet I never saw a reimbursement since airfare was paid for in April. I signed up for earlybird and SOUTHWEST changed my flight. My boarding pass showed no earlybird yet my original ticket shows earlybird. No refund for either flight
"Every time, without fail, this airline is at LEAST 30 minutes late. I avoid this crappy airline if I can but unfortunately sometimes I have  to take a one way because the return time I want isn’t available on better, less crappy airlines. I’d almost rather not travel at all than sit on this cattle car and bake because the AC sucks while you are sitting, waiting. Pay for business class but why? Still packed airplanes with zero leg room and no arm room. So frustrating."
"I am 47 years old and a frequent flyer on Southwest. I have never encountered this kind of customer service on any airline before in my life.Barry is the name of the flight attendant that yelled at my 3 yr old daughter. She was sitting at the window seat. I was sitting in the aisle seat and my wife was in between us.I woke up to Barry leaning over me with his head right in front of my face yelling forcefully and directly to my 3 yr old daughter. My wife was in shock and froze.My daughter had put some decorative children’s tape on the window and seat in front of her. It peels off very easily. It’s one of several plane activities my wife had prepared for our young daughter. We removed the tape immediately.I don’t mind Barry asking me to remove the children’s tape or for my daughter not to put children’s decorative tape on the window and seat but his tone was intimidating and scary. His aggression toward my 3 yr old daughter was uncalled for, rude, and embarrassing. He is a loose canyon.I could hear others around me talking about how he acted and I decided to try and say something to him.Next time he came around, I politely tried to suggest to him that he did not need to use that tone with my 3 yr old daughter. He immediately snapped cutting me off and said something like, “if you don’t like it, write a letter to Southwest”. I couldn’t believe it.I had tried to ask him nicely and he was doubling down. He continued, “this is not your property, if you think it is ok to deface someone else’s property, then write a letter to Southwest”.I was calm and was trying to talk to him discreetly, but he was loud and made a scene.I said, “I didn’t say anything about WHAT you said, I’m talking about ‘how’ you said it”. He did not seem to understand the distinction.He said, “I don’t have time for this. If you have a problem with what I said, write a letter to Southwest”It was a very unpleasant experience and I hope no one else has to go through that."
"I arrived in Orlando 2 hours early for my flight to Columbus. Was told at desk since I was more than an hour early I had to leave my bags with an overweight young lad with his shirt out and a F you attitude. I put my golf bag on a cart , he took my suitcase and threw it on the floor inside a room. Upon arrival in Columbus, I got my golf bag but not my suitcase. Along with 27 others who were missing luggage. We were told by the baggage people to fill out a form and when the luggage arrived we could either pick it up (along with a $300 certificate) or they would bring it to us THAT NIGHT. I live 2 hours away. I chose for them to deliver it. When they called and said they had it, and confirmed my address (which I had already done with their worthless online app), I was told I was outside their delivery area and I could either come pick it up or they’d have Fed Ex deliver in three days. I’m working next three days so I can’t go get it. Half the clothes I have are in that suitcase. I have one appropriate outfit to wear the next three days to work. It was not my fault they missed 28 bags (probably due to that young boys lackadaisical attitude. Their customer service sucks"
"They apparently are counting small fanny packs now. I suppose it makes sense since I heard they plan to start counting neck pillows. Soon they will probably start limiting people to one bag total. Flight staff are inconsistent. Some of them are helpful, others will nitpick you."
"We were traveling from Pittsburgh to Baltimore, then connecting to Raleigh Durham.  Flight 1714, July 11, 2024, Boarding at 12:50 PM.   My husband and I are seniors I'm 79, he's 83.  I have COPD.  The Customer Service Agent (Phyllis) saw my distress when I arrived at her desk, got me a wheelchair and got one for my husband too!  She was a sweetie, very attentive to our needs and a Hugh compliment to your Airline.  In my younger days I worked in hospitality and in fact, taught customer service in several hotels from Pittsburgh to Washington DC.  Please reward this sweet lady, she's an asset to your Airline."
"The no assign seating practice is highly inappropriate. This is a country of selfish people who like their space. It makes no sense. Today takes the cake though. There were 2 empty seats back by the bathroom and they didn’t allow anyone to sit there on a very full plane. As someone traveling with their spouse and who uses the bathroom a lot; it sucks. You can screen share or be with them. If the plane crashes you’re all alone even if you didn’t travel alone. Why even assign seats in the ticket if it’s total bs. People aren’t kind to move and flight attended aren’t gonna play that game. Everything else about southwest is pretty dope; so to be fair I give 3 stars. Also, the snacks are peanut free but have multiple other of the top deadly allergies and they have the audacity to call it an allergy friendly snack. My allergies disagree as does the nutritional label (see ingredients list)."
"Overall, a descent airline all things considered- but then again travel isn’t what it use to be… in my most humble but accurate opinion, the enjoyment, the experience of flying to see family, or the excitement of taking a vacation to someplace where you’ve never been, is lacking. More like being a seat assignment than a passenger. And certainly cellphone phones have added significantly to the equation of making us a very impersonal society."
"I personally only fly Southwest.  I absolutely love them! As someone who is disabled they have made travel so much easier for me and their staff is so friendly and amazing.  I've never had an issue with Southwest and based on my experiences if I do, I'm sure they'll help figure out a solution.  My only suggestion is that BWI is fully redone inside.  It could use a people mover system for sure, but that's largely out of their control.   Their operations though out of Rochester, NY are superb as are their operations out of Orlando and BWI."
"If I could give Southwest Airlines no stars I would. After a recent trip to Vail Colorado for my son’s wedding  my flight home to Charleston was a nightmare. After boarding the plane a medical supervisor told us we had to deplane ,holding up the rest of the plane, as my husband told the check in person that  he had some altitude sickness in Vail. He was fine in Denver and felt fine on the plane. After quite the embarrassment,they made us leave and said we could be checked out by their EMT.  The EMT determined  my husband was fine but they still wouldn’t let us back on the plane. After kicking us off the flight for no apparent reason, they didn’t  even offer to help rebook and let us stay at the airport for a day and a half to get home to Charleston without any assistance. If they thought my husband was so sick so he couldn’t fly, which was not the case,they should’ve been more sympathetic and helpful. Poor everything!"
If I could leave less then 1 star I would.  My experience has been poor from start to finish twice I have been delayed.  One delay was long they caused me to miss my connection flight.  They didn't even bother assisting me with finding a new flight until I went to the customer service booth. The 2nd time they ask us to line up to board and then tell us to sit....the pilot called out.  I will never book with this airline ever again.  I have been treated as if I bought my ticket from a bargain basement sale
"The 1135 Southwest flight from Cancun ti Atlanta was significantly delayed. Fortunately we were met with an understanding, courteous, and professional crew of flight attendants that served us with polite responses to the delays, emphathtic engagement about the delays, and went beyond the call of duty to provide updates about connecting flights that were on time, gone, or delayed.  The fact that they even provided instructions to assist the passengers with missed connections was just an amazing act of kindness.   Some customers were very rude about the delays and but your team of flight attendants met their negativity with professional grace and positivity while explaining the delays to the best if their abilitity.  The level of humor, engagement, quality service, professionalism, and empathy was wonderful.  Please celebrate and congratulate the following crew for an AMAZING job done:  Celestine Armstead, Derric Allen Rogers, and Phillip Jefferey Sorel!  Please donʼt forget the pilot team as well:  Captain Leon Boyd Newman Jr. and Flight Officer Christian Winford Barnes!  Thanks again for an excellent job done in the mist of a difficult situation that was out of their control.  I Love Southwest!"
"Southwest Airlines is the best airline. We recently experienced a maintenance issue during one of our connecting flights. However, the Southwest staff handled the situation with exceptional professionalism and provided us with an alternate plane. To our surprise, we received an email this morning informing us that they would be sending a voucher as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience, without us even having to request it. This is a prime example of how a business should operate. I am grateful that I chose Southwest Airlines and will continue to choose them in the future because they truly deserve it."
The flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix was beautiful and have no complaints there. But at Sky Harbor airport at Baggage Claim my suitcase is purple and it's a plastic one with a pink name tag. Also the zipper that you can open to expand doesn't zip all the way. So I saw my suitcase and grabbed it bc of those identifiers. About 20 minutes later southwest representative calls me and said I had the wrong suitcase and of course I was so embarrassed and my step dad takes me back to the airport we were 20 minutes away. I get there and was apologizing a lot. The one Southwest employee a black woman went off on me and I was blown away. It was uncalled for and she was about to be recorded. So then I explained to the male employee what through me off and he agreed when be looked at the suitcases side by side that zipper was like mine and the pink tag like mineYes I should have looked at my name and I learned a lesson from it. And the person who the suitcase belong to was so ignorant I understood she was upset I would be also. However when I'm apologizing and I legit felt bad the least she could have done was acknowledge that. And your employee yelling at me in front of people was the most disgusting way to treat people in that line of work. I'm 52 yrs old and worked in customer service my adult life and I have never treated anyone like that. I could give her a pass if i was ignorant to her. It's not like I was in the plane to another state I was 20 minutes away and I never touched the suitcase from putting it in the car. I landed at 7:05 pm from Pittsburgh to Sky harbor on Flight 3466. My name is Michelle Strachan and the black woman who is a southwest employee that yelled at me like a child in front of people should be dealt with because she will cause that airline more problems without a doubt. And it was a honest mistake that I felt bad about and please pay attention when a customer  goes through something like that and is it in your policy to Tell your employees to yell at another adult who is not being disrespectful at all that it's acceptable that they act that way. I didn't record her but I almost did and it would have big a huge headache for your damage control team.
"I was coming home from Reagan International airport to St Louis on flight 4670, the landing was the most horrible experience I have ever had with ANY airlines. I really thought we weren’t going to make it, the worst flight ever!!!I have been traveling with Southwest for years…. I should probably change."
"we flew for the first time and they ruined my luggage. the lady at the baggage dept told us to scan the bar code but never said you have 4 hrs. go to website big issues so had to have nice lady file for us told us they are good at taken care of this issue. send all the info pictures and receipt. Now told nope not paying cause you only had 4 hrs. so this is now they treat customers. Will never Fly them again. they do owe me for destroying my suitcase, it to top it off the lady who works for them said happens all the time and you shouldn't buy that kind cause it doesn't expand wasn't that nice of her.jamie"
This airline is BROKEN and I hope Elliot Management can turn it around.  Please stop trying with the folksy inflight service attempts and just fix your planes and upgrade your maintenance problems  #lasvegas #5022 #abq
"I would like to take out this time to thank Michele Peebles for being so diligent and calling my family back in regards to my mom‘s walker that she left at the airport the service was outstanding, and hopefully this reaches the right individual to give her her recognition of representing the company very well. This just goes to show they’re still good people out there and we definitely appreciate your services. Hopefully you have a great and bless day and thanks once again for being who you are a genuine kindhearted person we wish you all the best and keep doing what you’re doing and that’s being great"
Honestly all the flights I have been on this year (5+) have been delayed and I am pretty tired of them not knowing why/doing anything to fix it. Sure you get baggage check for free but at 2hrs delay not worth it. The quality has plummeted. I cannot wait for the new law to come into affect because Southwest will owe their customers millions. About time they had someone keep them accountable.
"Southwest Hotels provided the worst, most botched up hotel reservation experience of my life, and I'm a 63-yr-old frequent traveler, so that takes some doing!In mid-March booked a hotel stay  for 5 nights in June in Orange County. Received confirmation of the booking by Southwest, who was usin Agoda search engine. All seemed fine; Southwest even emailed me about the upcoming stay more than once to make sure I was organized. Then, we arrive on the day, and there is no booking in the hotel's system. An hour on the phone in the hotel lobby (mostly on hold) with Southwest Concierge, and finally they tell me they had a problem getting the payment that was successfully charged to my credit card in March to the hotel.No attempt to contact me. No attempt to fix it and find me another hotel. No offer of points for my trouble or.to compensate me in any way for the stress and inconvenience they caused me and my partner. Just s lame apology from the poor sap at the call center and an ""offer"" to refund me the money charged to my credit card in March in 7-10 business days.Southwest needs to GET OUT of the business of hotel booking, as a look in google shows their performance is horrendously bad. I will never use this joke of a service again, and neither should anyone who wants to be able to trust that their hitel confirmation actually IS a confirmation without having to follow up behind the booking agency.For your peace of mind, I recommend you AVOID SOUTHWEST HOTELS ENTIRELY and Use Booking.com instead. That's who I turned to to secure a hotel stay at the last minute. I've used them dozens of times with no issues like this. Until Southwest Hotels can get its act together, it is likely to cause you grief."
I have almost always had great experience with Southwest Airlines. Great rewards program. Good flight experiences (except for weather delays that affect all airlines). Lack of extra fees for flight changes and baggage. Friendly staff.A couple of caveats: They never seem to have direct flights to anywhere I want to go. The Internet is often down. Business select doesn't offer much if you don't want a free drink. Early boarding (low A's) doesn't mean as much if there are so many preboarders.
"This airline is quite straightforward, you know what you will pay and there are no hidden fees. Plus the 2 checked in luggage pieces are an advantage"
"THE WORSE RAPID REWARDS PROGRAM FOR HOTELS! they are deceitful. They are liars. They told me I would get a refund for a hotel if the hotel would accept the refund. Hotel accepted. Got them both on the same line. They completely lied. Daniela is the supervisor- truly worse customer service rep I have ever encountered. She is not a problem solver, has no customer service etiquette.  I have a SW airlines credit card I will be canceling. I will no longer be flying or using miles on SW airlines. the WORST"
It’s not just one time! It’s multiple times and occasions I’ve been stuck dealing with bad service from southwest: I’m currently on a flight now that hasn’t taken off because some unknown occurrence. This stuff is terrible and it’s time for change! I mean for myself! I’m on my way to never flying southwest again. Never should my American dollars be used to help fund another person agenda at the cost of my happiness. 🖕🏽🖕🏽 southwest
It’s hit and miss on flight experience. Some attendants are rude. DO NOT purchase their internet. It is the worst. All other airlines are better. They are always in the crappiest parts of airports. I reached out to customer service on the plane and told to contact customer service. It was their online customer service. I was on the plane and I told them. I basically got “too bad.”  Thank god my company is moving towards Delta.
"I fly from Las Vegas to Long Beach very frequently in the last two times I’ve flown I’ve try to sit by the window and people say that the seat is reserved.  I’m like, can passengers do that?  I’m in the flight right now and it happened again.  I believe is open seat.  Not to reserve.  Thank you for listening"
If you get a text stating your flight is delayed...IGNORE IT since they can still board and leave at the original time.  They claim the text is a courtesy notice to leave you stranded which happened to my husbands flight today from Tampa to Denver...text said flt 1110 was departing at 1:38pm instead of 11:40am...it left at 12:04pm.
"Fly them all the time.  Flying today and the flight attendant forced me to remove my bag from the overhead for someone whos bag was too big to fit under the seat.  The person came on late with 2 bags.  I had one, but they made mw move mine.  Im well over 6ft tall.and this left me with no leg room to stretch.  Usually I can stretch out with my legs under the seat in front of me but not today.  If thats how Southwest wants to treat loyal customers, I will fly someone else"
"I had things stolen from my checked baggage. I also don't like that they don't assign seats. You are put into a group and one group at a time goes on the plane and you can sit where you want. I paid for business select and didn't get a good seat. I paid $125 to get upgraded and it was for nothing. Also, one of the luggage check-in guys was very rude to me and I only asked a reasonable question. I will NEVER fly this airline again."
"We have been flying Southwest Air for many years.  Well, yesterday on Flight 1571 from LAX to BWI, we experienced the worse flight of our life.  There was an older Flight Attendant that was not allowing people to get to the bathroom, she tossed snacks at you, and yelled loudly at an elderly gentleman.  The Lead Flight Attendant told us that WiFi would not be available on our flight.  For almost five (5) hours, we listened at crying, loud babies and kids.  My Husband called today to complain about the problems and was pretty much blown off by another older sounding woman at their Corporate Office.  Their flights are now full, the bottom of the seat is thin and if you are sitting in front of a child, you could be kicked in your back the entire flight—my experience.  No longer recommended!"
"I missed my flight due to auto problems, then when I got to the airport, the agent booked me for the next flight. Except she didn't book my second leg, or my return flights, and didn't tell me. At the gate I asked the gate agent about my connecting flight and the guy said I didn't have one. So he booked that for me, but didn't book a return flight, and he didn't tell me that. I guess, stupid me, I assumed those jerks would know I have to get back home and paid for a round trip fare. A couple days later when I didn't see a ""check in"" email for my return flight. I called and they said I didn't have a return flight and would have to pay another $198 to fly back. So I got double charged for the exact same flight because two agents screwed up. Their customer service/complaints people basically told me to go pound sand, it's just policy. What crap. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, and I fly a ton. That's it for southwest. I'm taking my business elsewhere."
"Southwest has always been my go to airlines. Being wheelchair bound disabled, no airlines has done such a outstanding job as Southwest. They've always treated me with upmost respect, helping me from my chair into my seat and folding my power wheelchair down so it can be loaded into the belly of the plane. Of all my locations, the staff that handles luggage, has taken great care of my wheelchair as it weighs 65 lbs. I can't express my gratitude enough for all they do."
SWA has a number of good features like low prices - we do not pay for upgrade to sit closer to the front - and SWA does not charge for checked bags. Changes/transfers are easy and don't cost too much if you get the upgrade. I have the Rapid Rewards credit card that earns points with everything you purchased. My round-trip flight from KC to Philadelphia was purchased with points.
"Worst airline. I made the mistake of paying double for their “ business class.” What a huge mistake. I thought I was treating myself but unfortunately about 30% pre boarded and took all of the premium rows. So even being A3, I was far back, crappy uncomfortable seats.Pro tip, fake a handicap and you can get the  perimeter seats for no extra charge."
"On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request.The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience.I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies.I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience. I will be choosing American Airlines for future travel."
"TSA randomly selects people for a secondary screening at the gate, which is out of all airlines control. However, with most airlines assigned seating, this only affects the flight you are selected for the screening for and doesn’t affect your boarding. With Southwest’s check in and reservation system, getting selected for secondary screening means you are in for major issues. Southwest’s well rehearsed response by phone support, check in personnel and gate agents, for the multiple impacts, is that it is not our fault’. That you were selected by the TSA, not Southwest, so you get nothing from Southwest to help rectify the situation of getting a late C group number when you went to all the trouble to check in and your spouse on the same reservation gets A group.It is true that it is TSA for being selected for the extra secondary security screening for the first flight. However, all the issues on subsequent connecting fights are caused by Southwest's reservation system and boarding process. There is no reason not to get assigned your legitimate place in line on the rest of your connecting flights as the TSA screening has nothing to do with them. Even worse then not being able to board with the rest of your party on the reservation on subsequent flights, is losing your TSA Pre Check from paying for Global Entry on the rest of your connecting flights. On international flights you usually need to go through security again after clearing customs. On my recent trip back from Mexico, the rest of my party with TSA Pre Check cleared security in 5 minutes and then waited another 50 minutes for me to finally show up. This is very much Southwest's issue. Other airlines with different reservation systems have none of these issues.There are things that Southwest could have and should have done on my connecting flight. I clearly should have had an A group number as all other folks on the reservation with me did. All the numbers are gone since the Southwest system would not assign my connecting flight boarding position since it wouldn’t assign the 1st flight. However, Southwest lets ""special circumstance"" folks board after the A group, before the B group. When I asked the gate agent in Miami, Monica V., if there was anything I could do to board at least close to the rest of my party, she parroted the party line that is was TSA’s fault and that there was nothing she could do. When I mentioned boarding after the A’s, she got that hostile look like I was just another low life trouble maker trying to cheat my way onto the plane before my turn. She stated that was ONLY for disabled passengers and my issue was not a Southwest problem.An even better solution is for Southwest to still issue you your boarding position number for your connecting flights and not remove TSA PRE from your connecting flight boarding pass"
"We have used Southwest a number of times and we have been very pleased with the service. We just got back from Panama city Florida and the service at check in all the way to boarding was seamless. The Southwest flight attendants are great! Can't go wrong with 1st bag free also. Personally, we like the choose your own seating once on board verses the assigned seating on other airlines."
I like this airline. I’ve flown with them multiple times last year. I mistakenly flew with United last week. Their app isn’t work and they don’t include carryon in the ticket price. United airlines is such a scam and I missed the service and ease of southwest. Just wanted to say I appreciate an easy and smooth experience.
"I need to cancel a flight due to Covid travel restrictions.  I was given a travel voucher but unable to re-book withing one year, again due to Covid travel restrictions.  Southwest refuses to honor my voucher.  They just took my money and will not work with me in way except to say sorry we are keeping your money."
"Onboard SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight from Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale, just as the door closed to leave, I was assaulted by the Flight Attendant. As I was saying goodbye to my husband on my phone, a male flight attendant leaned past two passengers to jab his fingers into my shoulder. I was sitting in the window seat and suddenly felt pain in my shoulder from this male flight attendant's assault. I recently had rotator cuff surgery, and I was shocked that a man just poked me there. I am a 63 year old woman, and I pre-boarded due to disabilities. When I looked at him he said ""turn off your cell phone now"". The preparation announcements were just being made when this assault took place. As I said, I was telling my husband goodbye . With doors flying off, DEI hiring of pilots, and all the horrors of flying, I ALWAYS tell my husband I love him just before I take off. I did nothing wrong, and certainly, NO FLIGHT ATTENDANT HAS THE RIGHT TO JAB HIS HAND INTO ANYONE'S SHOULDER. Well, I contacted Southwest Airlines and they essentially called me a liar. (It took a month for a response from SWA) I provided them with full details and also a photograph of this flight attendant. Their delayed response was that the feedback of the crew member was that he did not recall. They quoted their policy: ""Once the entry doors are closed in preparation for pushback, cellular voice and data functions must be turned off"". So instead of being appalled and sorry for this assault, they implied somehow I did not know about turning off cell phones. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, yet NO ONE SHOULD BE physically assaulted by a flight attendant. SWA doesn't have the right to lay hands on a passenger. My complaint was completely blown off, and swept under the rug by SWA. They ended the correspondence by ""We hope you  will fly Southwest Airlines again and that your support and confidence is very important to us"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Why would I fly them again after they physically assaulted me? So after they assaulted a 63 year old woman with disabilities they took no responsibility, They we're very clear that somehow it was my fault that I was assaulted. Well, I am done flying SWA. There are better airlines that value their passengers and treat their passengers with respect."
"The day before our scheduled flight I checked in through the app. I called my wife to ask if she had checked in, but she was having difficulty w/the app. I called customer service. Within a few minutes the customer service rep had fixed the problem & even had her booked in a better group. SWA customer service doesn't always get the credit & positive recognition they deserve.In addition, when we were checking in for our flight, there was a line for 75 plus people. The local SWA employee in St. Louis had a great attitude & was so positive in all her interactions with all those trying to check in. Again, I just want to give credit & recognition to the many who do a great job every day. Thank you."
"I think many people only leave a review when they have something negative to say. I've flown on Southwest Airlines for 30 years without issues. I think they lost my bag once, but that happens with every airliner. The Southwest staff is SO MUCH friendlier than other airlines. Southwest's prices are often cheaper than others, too. I've had a few unfortunate situations with Southwest, but out of all other airliners, I've had the LEAST amount of issues with Southwest. Even when I call their main customer support line, the agents are understanding, courteous, and helpful. It's a reality that problems will occur in any business. I appreciate Southwest's importance on customer service. Definitely my favorite airline!"
"Our flight was canceled due to weather from Denver >Milwaukee. I made a mistake on how I booked our flight out. Which was over $740.00, but I was told to just call customer service & I’d get my money back. The next day when I called the I-FLY-SWA #  I told the representative the situation (3) timesShe replied all 3 times “we don’t refund for flights already taken” So thinking she was just having a rough day I hung up. I immediately called again and got a rep. 1. That listened to my situation, 2.put me on hold to ask what to do.  &  3. When she came back on, she said she understands the issue,& opened a claim report and SW would research the situation.YEAH, within 4 days I received a call that I would receive a full refund. And 2 weeks later I received all my money for the flight I booked unwittingly. KUDOS to Southwest for understanding and refunding my money. I know I didn’t follow prodigal but it is stressful when a flight is canceled, and I did what I thought was correct. but again SW thank youIt did cost me 1 nights stay in a hotel as Southwest does not pay for a room if weather related but that was minimal compared to the 747.00 flight.So despite the 1st.call, I STILL give SW a 5 STAR rating.! For knowing we are all human."
I used to fly SW Airlines almost exclusively and continuously promoted it.  In the past year it has gone completely down the tubes.  I fly to ABQ from DEN at least once every 3 weeks on business.  Now I am on United first class.  I can afford it and it is well worth the not great fare difference.  SW has been over 1 hour late on the return flight over 4 times in a row.  The gate agents have now become terribly rude and inconsiderate.  I have 80k points on my SW Rapid Rewards account and I am just going to give them away rather than endure the torture and inconvenience.
BUYER BEWARE! Early check in fees are non-refundable. I learned the hard way and thank goodness it was only $25. Everyone should know this before adding the early check-in. Very customer unfriendly!
"Is there a way to give less than one star? I attempted to cancel my flight WITHIN 24 hours during massive storms, and I couldn’t cancel it on the app. So I thought ok, I’ll call. How hard could that be. I was on hold for hours. When I finally got someone, they told me it was just past 24 hours (which was their fault for the wait times and the fact their app was down) and to contact complaints. I tried complaints, who sent an email saying tough luck and gave no way to respond. I tried chatting in. Tried calling in again to talk to a supervisor. They said “we don’t have supervisors.” Abominable service, and the reason I had to change my flight was due to a family member who was extremely sick, as I told Southwest. Airline with a heart? Worst airline I’ve dealt with. Don’t expect help or humanity from them."
"We had a bit of a flight-booking panic in January 2024 as we were packing for our upcoming trip the next day. I remembered booking a flight for my partner; however, we could not find the reservation.I looked on my account and my partner’s, but the reservation was not listed. We were headed to work an event that we could not miss. So we had to purchase a last minute flight for $465 as missing work would have wasted three months of preparation.My partner received an email the next day stating that their reservation had been cancelled. This was for the flight that I had initially booked that didn’t appear on either of our accounts, and we could not find.I contacted Southwest by phone and was referred to their customer service email support system and they responded coldly nine days later by simply quoting their policy on FRIDAY afternoon! SWA/Donna, can you please NOT give devastating news on Friday?SWA Case#: 84809854Sad to say, but like most corporations today, once they’ve got your money, you are not important. I think I’m going to drive from now on."
Booked Roundtrip flights for September 2023. We had also purchased the early bird for both legs of the trip. When it came time 36hrs before flight to check in for seat assignments we received a notice that we could nt get seat assignments until 24 hrs and that Southwest would let us know are boarding numbers. Then we received and email that said they could upgrade us to A boarding if we paid another $50 a piece.... which added up to an additional $100 dollars each for both legs of flight. That was $200 extra for both of us.....on top of the $100 dollars we already paid for the earlier Early bird fee when we booked the flight. We booked our flights four months prior to departure. I tried to find out what was going on but no one would answer my questions. There were several passengers with the same issue. Southwest had decided to change the way they do the early bird and the increased fee without any prior notification. Tried to get answers to what was going on from boarding person but she told me to contact the airlines directly. had to email because no one answered the phones and I was told sorry but there was nothing they could do since the fee's had changed literally like a day or two before our flight. I tried to get them to refund the early bird fee's that we had already paid earlier since we did not get early bird seating after all and could not pay an additional $200 at that point. Basically I was told there was nothing they could do. I have flown Southwest for many years but this last experience was enough to make me look elsewhere. To ask us to pay an additional $200 each for the flight.... was totally unreasonable. And I could have booked thru another airline for less than they wanted me to pay for the Southwest airlines increase and would have gotten assigned and reserved seats in the process. Will definitely being flying with another airline in the future
"We were involuntarily bumped from our flight. Come to find out that Early Bird Checkin isn't really a checkin, it holds your boarding position, but doesn't count as a checkin, so we were last in the checkin list since we printed our boarding passes when we got to the airport. This meant we were the last to checkin and the first to get bumped for an oversold flight. The advertise and push early bird, but don't tell you this key information. Rather deceptive marketing to make a quick buck.Meanwhile, our luggage took off without us, leaving us stranded in Denver, with sub freezing temperatures and no winter jacket because we put those in our checked luggage since overhead and carryon space is always a problem. They stole our luggage and stranded us without proper clothing in a harsh climate.They gave us a check for the inconvenience and rebooked us for the next day, but doesn't help when we don't have jackets and have to expose ourselves to the cold to get to the shuttle and find a hotel.Our rebooked flight was cancelled and rebooked, but if I wasn't checking my email, I would not have known and been able to properly checkin again.The gate people did not provide us with a printed document explaining our rights as they should in accordance with DOT requirements, let alone could not tell us the base price of our leg for that flight in the refund they issued.They don't care about customers, just about filling their planes to make a buck."
Always fly Southwest whenever possible.So flexible it takes the stress out of travel.Great customer service.
Flight from Washington DC to Atlanta.  LATE 30 MINUTES.No reasons given!Service has really gone downhill in the last 3 to 4 years.
"This company went downhill.  First of all, the ticket counter made us get rid of stuff to board the plane.  We left our personal things at the ticket counter worth over an estimated $400 dollars because we were a few pounds over company policy.  After fumbling around the ticket counter for an hour, we almost miss our flight.  My family (wife, infant, toddler) had to run to the departure booth.  The manager at Myrtle Beach airport for southwest was extremely rude and mean.  She deserves to be be fired!  We were about to board the plane and she made us take things out of our bags (again!) and move things around saying we had too much stuff.  We had just been hassled at the ticket booth and dropped our stuff on the curb.  The manager and her ticket collector tried to charge us for the baby carrier. The manager and her staff at Myrtle Beach international airport were burned out, disrespectful and  mean.  We finally get on the flight and the male flight attendant gave me a sarcastic remark ""you know, we allow free checked bags right?""  Talking to me as if I did not know and I'd rather carry all my family stuff on carry on.  “We are moving, and not on a vacation and had maxed out on checked bags,” I said. I should not have to defend my self to smart remarks on the plane.  Of course no flight attendants helped with our luggage while I had a baby and and infant. One of my bags was ripped when I received the bag in New York.  I then had to buy a $65 dollar bag to cover the ripped bag on my connection.   Of course the new bag also ripped receiving on the next airport. Absolute horrible flying experience."
Southwest flight was delayed on leg one; I had paid early bird fee and had an A Grp boarding pass.SW rebooked for free but went from A to C on that first leg and A to B on the second leg - which was the same flight from the original itinerary.Of course they kept my money.Lesson here - don’t drink the SW Kool Aide. Don’t buy upgrades - good chance it’ll just be a looser.Happy Trails
fat people get extra seats with no extra fees and are kicking out passengers of the airplane because of this. this is not okay!!!
"My daughter got up at 3 am to catch an early flight to Portland.  She had her carry on, and little dog in her carrier, her cell phone, passport, jacket etc., She met her ride, and turned over her dog to him, and put her carry on in his car.  Then went back to pick up her luggage.  Hearing her name paged to go to security, they had found her purse!  It was left behind on the seat.  It had some ID and all of her cash.  Everything was still in it.  She tried to tip the security but he refused.  Great customer service.  Thank you so much.  Would definitely fly Southwest with employees like this kind person."
WORST AIRLINE! How can an obece fattass take 3 seats from a mother and her 11 year old child!
"I was at the airline where I saw you boot out a mother and two children for one fatty to have 3 seats. 3 literal seats. How can someone even take up that much s[ace? You [your so sad that you cant have cussing or take criticism can you?] literally stranded a mother and two children because of one obese woman? You all suck, your policy is crap. Your glorifying obesity and you are all a pile of horse sh-"
"I flew Southwest airlines To go to Disney world from Saint Louis Missouri. I am in a wheelchair. Everyone in southwest airlines was accommodating, kind and courteous. They went out of the way to make sure I was comfortable on the way to Orlando and back home."
Horrible. They will kick you out of the flight and leave you stranded because a fat person asked for an extra seat. This is their actual policy.
"Southwest Airlines - poorly trained reservation personnel, no communication when they created an issue, no customer service to resolve a problem they created.We are sitting in the airport in San Jose, Costa Rica.  Had booked our roundtrip flights in November.  Art booked by calling Southwest directly as we were returning to the U.S. with our cat as carryon.  I had checked the Southwest website, and Art told the agent when he was making the reservations that our cat was coming back with us.  She charged an extra fee for the cat and said that the cat replaces one of our carryons.Art called Southwest and confirmed our reservations , including the cat as we did not receive our expected email for priority check in, which had been paid for.  Reservations confirmed.We checked the Southwest app this morning, and our first leg, San Jose to Houston had disappeared.  We called Southwest at 3am, and took awhile but Southwest person on the phone located our reservation, and had it fixed.  She confirmed that the cat was on our reservation.We get to the airport, and our first leg, Costa Rica to Houston had disappeared again.  After checking, and bringing over a supervisor, they found out reservation - but told us that the cat was not allowed on an International flight.  We were told we could fly, but not the cat.  Despite   first being booked directly on the phone with Southwest, and having two other phone conversations, including the cat flying with us - we were left standing at the San Jose, CR airport unable to board our flight.Despite our asking, Southwest personnel would make no attempt to get us aboard a different airline to rectify this situation.Terrible personnel training, no communication, and very poor customer service with a situation they created.Luckily, we were able to get a flight out later today with JetBlue.  Now will be up for 24 hours with the new flight.  Poor Bramble will be in his carrier for almost as long ...."
"Sitting and reading the new celebration about giving fat people more seats and refuse ordinary families boarding, because a fat person had to get their seats.Not gonna happen and hope Southwest Airline will be sued out of business for this disgusting policy!"
"This is the sh*tbox airline. Crappy old Planes, horrible flight attendants who hate their work & a scammer no assigned seat policy where if I buy business class on ALASKA I know I am getting seat 1A regardless of the cripples,old people & ret&rds. But no. These degenerates & their 20 cohorts first so by the time I Board Im in row 7 seat ?  What the eff! Never again. This p*ss poor excuse for an airline needs to be shut down or just cater to the hoi poloi!"
Every flight I'm on is always delayed. If you fly this POS AIRLINE YOU KNOW.
"Southwest needs an overhaul! I will never fly this airline again out of Charlotte! No kiosk for checkin. You have to stand in line for minimum, sn hour. If you pay extra for early boarding, you'll find a**holes that boarded and are saving seats for people that didn't pay. This SHOULDN'T be allowed. I hate this airline now and will never fly with them again."
"Southwest is my airline of choice, and I fly around 30 times a year. Free checked luggage, friendly people, easy to change flights, and that amazing companion pass are the reasons I continue to fly Southwest. I build up points faster here than with any other airline. Love it!"
"I flew to Chicago, worked in a non cell working area. Worked time went over with no access to call southwest and change flight. They took it as a no show and said nothing they could do. So no access to call them was a good reason. No sympathy for the customer situation. On the flight here my bags where over weight by one pound and they demanded $100 surcharge. I had to sit there and adjust my bags to clear the one pound. Then at boarding I get hit again about my bags overweight issue of one pound. That almost made me mis my flight. The plane was half empty from Texas to Chicago. So I stripped Southwest as a vendor in my company. By being treated this way they do not realize what this cost them in additional revenue. They will not get it from me."
"Prices are good but they allow people with three or four bags to board which impacts the comfort of everyone on the plane. The seat cushioning is almost criminal so beware if you have a long flight. On the plus side, I can always find a flight time that agrees with my schedule."
"POOPED ON!!!! Literally! SOUTHWEST Flight number #3332 from Las Vegas to Maui on August 31, 2023.  By a fellow passenger and Southwest refuses to pay for our damaged personal items.  I am reaching out through social media and the Internet to let people know about the situation. After many phone calls to Southwest corporate offices, they are still refusing to pay for the items that we’ve had to throw away. It all started when at the very beginning of our flight, we noticed a very bad smell coming from the woman in front of us. We thought that she was just having bad gas, but it smelled so bad the entire flight! When it was time to start getting ready to land, I reached under to get my belongings under her seat, and when I pulled them out and onto my lap, noticed that there was poop all over my things which by then had also got onto my arms and legs! I immediately got up and went to the front of the plane to speak with a steward and stewardess. They were shocked at what had happened and were so nice. In fact, the steward got into his own personal duffel bag, and gave me clothes to change into. I had to change in the front of the plane behind the steward, stewardess and my husband. Then quickly sit back down in another seat before we landed. After landing, we had to wait around for a very long time. We had to stand around the gate to talk to airport police and EMT. After a very long time EMT took her off the plane. She was completely soiled in her own feces, it was very sad. She had obviously just been released from the hospital because she had some kind of port in her hand and    bandages. She had not gotten up once the entire flight, and had continued to soil her self through the whole flight, and we had to sit behind and smell it the whole flight, and then deal with it getting on myself and our things. We were told by a SOUTHWEST employee that they had to unbolt and throw away the seats in that row she was sitting in! I have reached out many times to Southwest trying to get them to replace the items that I had to throw away. However, over and over they refused to be responsible for my damaged items. I tried to reason that since they threw their seats away and replaced them, then they should do the same for my things, but they refused. We have also had to get hepatitis testing due to the fact that her feces got onto my skin and I would like them to pay for that testing as well. Southwest says that they are not responsible for our damaged items. However, they are responsible for the actions of their passengers! Since Southwest will not contact me further regarding the situation, I feel the only thing left to do is to reach out to the Internet and social media, and let everyone know of this terrible situation. Thank you for taking the time to read this post."
"Flew from Baltimore to Pittsburgh 10/31/23 on flight 1211 at 11:10 am. What a wonderful, kind crew. Excellent flight and the attendants were much fun and a delight to fly with. The Captain actually pushed me in my wheelchair to the door of the plane.  What a great guy! Always liked southwest and they way they go above and beyond. Keep up the excellent service"
Nothing went wrong and I am a HUGE fan of Southwest. For the past 15 years I have flown this airline and refuse to fly any other.My complaint is in regard to the article about the woman and husband who were asked to leave the plane over a sweet little dog who WAS in a carrier. The woman consoled the dog buy giving the pup a pat to ease his anxiety and was called out by a flight attendant who was so full of themself it's a wonder he or she had room for breakfast in the morning!I NEVER expected this from Southwest! Always a great and welcoming airline??? I have had a dog on this airline who was allowed to sit on my lap! Has Southwest begun to hire flight attendants who are looking for people whom they can make miserable?I have some advice for Southwest and ALL airlines... HOW ABOUT THE BABIES AND UNRULY CHILDREN? They are much less behaved than any dog in a dog carrier!
Canceled flight with no compensation 0r concern. Very rude could careless attitude 😒 don't fly this group or you will be regretting it. Bad employees who offer no help at all. They should all be fired.
"If I could give this airline 0 stars I would do it! It is the worst. Never travel with them! The plane is disgusting and your luggage will arrive completely damaged. We were not able to check the luggage until 4 hours and 10 minutes after our flight and now they say we were too late with informing them (you can only claim until 4 hours after your flight). Go for Hawaiian airlines if you travel there, cause they are way way better and few extra dollars for your ticket will pay off!!!!!"
"Overall, I think they provide value for money. Their website is the fastest in the industry and easy to use."
"My luggage was delayed, causing me having to spend extra funds and make an additional round trip to the airport the next day. The agent on the night we arrived promised me that Southwest would handle my complaint swiftly and reimburse me for all my extra costs. Instead, Southwest has ignored the receipts I sent (including an extra day of parking fees, Uber, and missing brand new sunscreen) and the documentation showing my round trip the next day to the airport and back. All they do is make unrelated replies, which allows them to reset the clock another thrity days. Then when I call, I get the response, ""Well sir, we have 30 days to respond to any messages you send, no matter our response."" Southwest has rightfully earned the nickname SouthWorst. Even the intial response from Sumi in customer service states that he is sorry there was a delay to my luggage. He instructed me to attach all supporting documents for reimbursement. I did that. Then after finally responding after 30 days, he said, ""Please attach a photo of the damaged luggage."" Um what?!?!?! Yeah, they are there to play games with customers. I've been our over $141 for over month because of SouthWorst delaying my luggage. I've been such a loyal customer to them. Time to give Delta a try."
"I'm currently on flight #407 and the plane is NASTY! How are you expected to place your valuable items on a Nasty floor? The flight attendants ( I would write their name but they didn't have on name tags) are very rude and when asked they looked like they were used to flying under these conditions. I'm an A-lister and have never flown on a dirty, nasty plane. Did y'all fire the clean-up crew, Because this is sad and ridiculous!!@Southwest please explain!"
"Suitcase damaged. Immediatly reported. Southwind airlines did 3 times not answer, now states i am too late. Absolutely poor customer service. Very unseriousDO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE"
"In my former life, I worked as a consultant and traveled 2-3x per week, every week for about 9 years.When you travel that much, you get to experience the way airlines manage their customers and customer relations.In short, Southwest has been the single best, most reasonable, most helpful and most caring airline I have ever dealt with.If I'm traveling, the first place I book is thorugh Southwest.  Even if SW isn't the cheapest, I would rather pay a premium with SW, than travel anywhere else.I recently missed a flight b/c i was in bed sick and couldn't contact SW to cancel before the flight. When I did call their customer service, they refunded my fair 100% with no penalties or charges.  The next time I travel, I'm spending all of that money, plus some more, with Southwest."
Unreal how skewed their priorities are. This company is not run by adults and it shows. They value woke sexism and racism over safety and it’s despicable.
This is the worst Airline I’ve ever flown with. Southwest Airlines should be ashamed of themselves for how bad they are doing business. First of all we paid for our flight tickets and selected certain seats in certain areas. Now as usual before boarding the plane you have to wait until the attendant announces the zone area that you will be seated in. So if all that is the normal procedure then why on earth do I have to play musical chairs when I get on the plane. If I paid for a window seat than I expect a window seat not a middle seat for 4 hours. That is a sad surprise for a customer and I couldn’t even sit together with my wife. I purchased two seats that was together so what changed when we got on the plane? That was awful and terrible and no one had any clear answers for me. I will never fly with this airline again. And I will make it my mission to tell as many people as I possibly can to avoid you as well.
"SW has degraded significantly over the last 10 years, and until they step away from their woke ideology, I'm not flying with them."
"They are scammers, who hide the real intentions of their airline behind hyperlinks and fine print while outwardly acting like they are the easiest airline to change flights around with. They will take your money and then tell you that you are at fault for not reading fine print that is linked at the bottom of the page that contradicts their publicity campaigns."
"I just want to let people know that in light of the recent devastating fire on Maui, I was instructed by Hawaii’s Mayor via televised news to cancel plans to visit Maui.  I called Southwest Airlines to cancel my RT flights to MAUI.  They canceled my flight but would not refund my money. Instead they are holding my fare as a credit (without interest I might add).   Southwest also told me that I must now forfeit my early check in fee to total $50.  So, Southwest is hanging on to my ticket fare and keeping the early check in money that they encourage customers to purchase.   I actually may consult a lawyer on this one.   PS:  Heart felt wishes to the locals of Maui."
"Damaged my luggage and wont replace it. Threw it around and busted everything in it. My handle wont extend. Ill stick with delta!!! You get what you pay for, no wonder Southwest are cheap. Employees dont care!"
Relay for more than 12 hours. Totally no information was given to us. I recommend not to book them! The most baddest company i ever flew with.
Most NOT on time airline in the industry. Late 7 out of last 7 flights. I’m canceling my Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards card!
"Scabies! Need I say more?! Found this Hotel through Southwest Rapid Rewards Points and Booking.com. So I thought it might be OK for a 2 night stay.1. First bad sign - When we arrived the ""lady"" at the desk laughed in our faces when I asked if there was a continental breakfast served.2. Second bad sign she wanted $100 cash deposit even though the room was already paid for and reserved through Southwest and Booking.com.3. Arriving at the room, the door and locks were apparently kicked it at least a couple of times, and the elevator walls were rotted out at the bottom.4. The air conditioner really didn't work and kept turning on and off and took a full 12 hours to cool down the room even a little bit.5. Went to the Soda machines and ALL were broken and not working, was sent to the Polynesian hotel next door (same owners) and their soda machines were broken as well.6. After checking out, in the parking lot there was a family of ""immigrants"" staying at the hotel eating a watermelon with plastic spoons that was just sitting on the ground behind their car.7. Upon arriving back in NY my wife and I began itching and breaking out with pustules all over our bodies. It looked like chicken pox. We went to 2 different Doctors and was asked if we stayed anywhere in a hotel within the last week??? We said ""Yes"" - To which they answered ""well now you have Scabies!""Sooo - Thank you Southwest! and Thank you Booking.com! and Thank you Ocean Plaza of Myrtle Beach! Now we are tp endure weeks of suffering and medical treatment!So my advice is ""stay at your own risk!"""
"My recent flight experience with Southwest Airlines was very pleasant. From the check in to my final destination. I have a disability, so I can’t walk through the airport to get to the gate without wheelchair assistance. And the Southwest transportation assistant’s are very helpful, personable, knowledgeable and pleasant people. And will get you to your destination on time and will either stay with you or come back to ensure that you are boarded onto the plane safely. The flight personnel are very friendly and helpful as well to ensure your safety and comfort. I’ve never had a bad experience when I’ve travelled with this airline. As a matter of fact, I have a flight booked for next month."
"SW did not honor expired voucher they told me they would. Left stranded at BDL Windsor Locks Hartford Connecticut airport late evening with my 2 children. No customer service or employees at gate or ticket counter. They canceled flight due to engine trouble, an hour wait on board with poor air circulation. One single SW staff member was available to print vouchers for those who waited in line. Delaying us another hour and a 1/2 expecting a refund. However, a credit voucher was all they were willing to accommodate. Thankfully, American  Airlines got us home safely for a third less of the cost than Southwest charged me for the 14 day advanced purchase tickets aquited weeks prior to our flight.  When I receive my vouchers I recognize the ""expires 1 year from now statement"" on the ticket and brought that to the attention of the rep who printed it and handed it to me.  She stated (to the effect)  ""Just ignore that they don't go by that, they'll honor it""  My vouchers remained on my refrigerator behind a magnet for a long time past a year and I went to use them specifically for the emergency trip I would need to visit my mother who is in stage 4 Cancer and my family has informed me that I need to come now, last minute. Knowing from previous experience that the cost of airfare is ridiculously absurd if not purchased within the 14 advanced day period/window that my flight would be expensive. I saved the vouchers to use for this occasion as indicated previously and they denied them saying they have expired. Wiith health concerns of my own and work on hold, I haven't been able to come up with the funds currently/last minute to pay for my flight home to see my dying mother. I've flown with Southwest Airlines since the early 70s when they operated out of Dallas Texas in there startup years. SW was my favorite/number one airline of choice, up until this point. I called customer relations four times, I left emails to corporate as instructed to and never received a response. It's been four weeks. I called again yesterday spoke with two independent reps neither would honor my voucher and book detremental flight. Bear in mine this!  These provided vouchers were obtained during the onset of our Global pandemic, Coronavirus. I and the majority of Earthings refused to fly on a plane with uncertain contagious concerns of spreading the virus. If your one of those who believe its completely safe ans cannot catch the Coronavirus or any other illness aboard an enclosed, continuous air circulation cabin area and believe that, I pity you! Nobody at that time was flying in the air on aircraft. I certainly wasn't going to spend my vouchers on a planned flight. I saved them for emergency purposes only, such as this one and solely for this purpose. It's for the sake of using them because they canceled their flight and gave me vouchers instead of my money back leaving us stranded in Connecticut with no service. I have reached out to an attorney that I'm suing in general sessions court for $25000 The maximum allotted in General Sessions.  Here's one of my confirmation numbers for any of you who work for Southwest and would like to investigate further, pre-prepare for our case. SW Legal department doesnt reply or answer calls either. Don't call. You will receive no further communication from me. Here's are two out of three confirmation numbers to initiate your burden. 4GPXX0 here's a bonus for you... 4YBAEN - SHAME ON YOU SOUTHWEST AIRLINES!"
"Can I give zero stars?  Southwest (now Southworst) rebooked us midflight (while we were in the air) because they ""expected"" we would miss our connection from Las Vegas to San Diego.  But guess what?!?  We made it to the gate (C21) as they were announcing ""last boarding call"" and the gate agent was STILL boarding passengers and the plane doors not yet closed.  Then, gate agent ""Erika"" (who wears an ""aloha"" button but does not live aloha), refused to reissue boarding passes for myself, my wife and daughter plus another five or so passengers to whom SWA did the same thing. Erika tried saying there was a ""weight"" issue (but we know that's a lie!) and then said the ""higher ups"" said she could not give us boarding passes (passing the buck? Or a telling slip of the tongue?🤔).  Then after waiting at the counter Erika told us ""the doors are closed."" They certainly were at that point because she stalled us on purpose.Erika then called over Supervisor Polet N who also refused to provide ANY explanation why we were all denied boarding.  When we (I, ok, yes I am a lawyer) pressed Polet N about rebooking us on another flight (on any airline as required by federal law - which Polet agreed she was required to do) she put on her fake and superficial ""SWA smile"" and said simply, ""we are not going to do that.""  Polet did not even try.  No LUV there!!!Adding insult to injury SWA issued us a hotel voucher for the OYO Hotel (formerly the Hooters Hotel) which is a scuzzy, fleabag hotel that charges $40/ night and has $1 blackjack all day (that alone tells you everything you need to know about who SWA partners with!)The only thing I can think of that makes any sense is that SWA rebooked us midflight because they (yes, there are actual people who make these decisions) did not want to have to reimburse us for the cost our tickets if we missed the connection because of THEIR ramp delay and they cared more about an ""on time"" departure from Vegas (which they can claim when the plane doors are closed and they push back from the gate) than they did stranding a half dozen passengers in Vegas on a Sunday night.Oh, we did get $200 SWA LUV vouchers that we have to use within one year and only on another SWA flight - they really think I want to fly SWA again?!?  But a voucher is better for the bottomline than paying for missed flights caused by the airline's delay.In short, SWA screwed us and then did nothing to assist in correcting THEIR mistake.  Instead they stranded us with no explanation."
"My last four flights on SWA have been delayed extensively. Once a very efficient carrier to fly, they slid into the Spirit/Frontier pool in my opinion"
"I really hate this airline man. They can't even get their credits system right. They have these stupid voucher programs that you have to use before a certain date if you don't book a flight but they don't actually count  s flight credits because flight credits somehow don't expire. It's extremely confusing and not worth the hassle for an airline that barely goes any where even domestically. I'm at the end of my rope with them, truly"
"Our recent trip to and from BWI with layovers at MDW was delay-free.  And even though a previous return flight from PDX was cancelled due to a major storm system back East, Customer Service gave us three options to return the next day.  Airlines cannot control the weather, especially huge storm systems which can and do disrupt their operations nationwide.But they can control the remaining causes, including extended I.T. ""melt-downs,"" mechanical issues, and crew scheduling.Due to the widespread impact of the Covid epidemic, Southwest clearly failed to accurately predict the increase in demand for new pilots and the timing to retrain sufficient pilots returning from lay-off.  The result   continues to be a lack of adequate staffing, resulting in additional cancellations.And as for the several major I.T. ""melt-downs,"" I am sure that Southwest would admit there is no excuse.But despite all of this, basis my past and present experience with each and every Southwest employee, there is absolutely no comparison between Southwest and any other domestic airline, period."
"i understand that the weather conditions are not the staff’s fault, but they were not helpful at all. super impatient. our flight got canceled after multiple delays. will not be flying southwest again. my family is still in the airport trying to get our baggage and figure things out."
"Ahhhh! Sigh of relief.Southwest Airlines. Always, and reliably, excellent.Every time. Value, service, customer care.Slowly but surely, they have won our loyalty. Now we only travel with them.Heartfelt thanks Southwest 💕"
"Longtime Southwest flyer. They are not the same airline as they were concerning rewarding their loyal customers. They keep increasing the number of points you need to make tier status, cut flights to major destinations and no longer give frequent flyers drink coupons."
"URGENT COMPLAINT - confirmation number 27CYS7 - RR# 20713247251I am extremely disappointed that we drove to the Tampa International airport on 6/25/2023, waited for an hour to be told that our flight had been cancelled to DCA. The original customer service rep made an announcement and lied that the flight that we were moved to was a direct flight to DCA. It was not direct it was a layover overnight in Chicago. It was on my app where I was able to determine that she falt out lied over the intercom and to my husband, the flight was not direct, it was a layover in  Chicago that was 2 days later,  leaving Tampa International Airport on 6/27/2023. That change would caused us to be  overnight for two more days in Tampa, and then I was told there were no hotel accommodations that Southwest could provide.  We even asked Norma if we could contact Corporate and she said there was nothing that any of them could do about it. We have two small children, one that has Asthma and we would have had to stay in the airport overnight for 2 days since we they were not going to give us hotel accommodations for the inconvenience. After requesting that we be put on a flight that left on 6/25 as we originally planned, Norma  put us on a flight to Baltimore and that is an hour and a half away from our home. Then we had to have our 75 year old father come an hour away at a later time, to pick us up. We get to Baltimore and had to wait for a gate to be opened, and waited for over 30 minutes before even being able to get off the plane. We only fly Southwest, this is very disappointing. We should have been given a hotel stay, and we should have been told earlier about the flight cancellation. We landed around 10:10pm left BWI  3 hours of looking for our luggage. I even called the 1800 number for customer service to see if they could help and was told that all they could tell me was that our bags were there. I asked if I could file a claim and was told that I had to work with the customer service there at the Southwest desk.  The representatives  for SouthWest at BWI were rude, there was only one person that was helpful and that was LaKeisha Anderson. She was the only person that wasn’t rude and the only person who helped and showed true customers service. The other customer service reps either didn't have their badges on or had badges without names.  I would like to be reimbursed for all 4 of my return tickets and for this inconvenience. I can not believe this!Martha from Southwest customer service called me on 6/26 and was only able to offer a $250 credit per person for all 4 of us traveling, and thought that was enough compensation for Southwest gate assistance lying about the fly change,the automated system putting us on a flight that would leave 2 days later and was through Chicago to get to DCA, and then not offering us a hotel and transportation for those two day. Norma the flight attendant at the gate for Southwest telling us that Southwest doesn’t do hotel vouchers and she didn’t know were we would stay. To Norma transferring us to fly to Baltimore and then us dealing with rude and disrespectful Southwest employees, taking off badges so we couldn’t report them, then spending 3 hours in the airport looking for luggage. We landed at 10:15 and didn’t get any of our luggage until 1:19am. Shae worked to find two of them. At 1:27 LaKeisha ended up funding and bringing us our last luggage and was the only one helpful out the the entire staff. Shae helped looked for luggage but threatened customers. And all Southwest can offer for this experience is $250 per person. We should have a full refund at a min! Each one of those employees at BWI for Southwest that worked last night needs be terminated how they acted, except for LaKeisha. It’s ridiculous that she was the only respectful one. This needs to be escalated and we deserve more than the $250 per person that you all are trying to offer! We also deserve to know that you are doing something about the staff at the BWI airport!"
"To summarize:- A delay turned into a cancellation that should have just been a cancellation from the beginning.- Houston Southwest Hub is TERRIBLE!! (Even though their customer service was trying, the Southwest policies were just making it impossible to really help)- My LUGGAGE was SOPPING WET including everything that was inside of it! (thank God I was going to visit family and not going somewhere else but that was not the case for other people)-All in all, this was the worst experience with Southwest that I've ever had and for them to only give us a useless Hotel voucher for the evening was just Disrespectful and showed me they really don't care about their customers. Let me explain why.We traveled from Belize to St. Louis but had a layover in Houston. I normally never have any issues with Southwest; they're my go-to, but after this flight, I can NEVER travel through Houston and won't always look to Southwest as my number one.Our layover from Belize was four hours and the flight was a red-eye so we got food and relaxed for a little while we waited. As we got closer to boarding, a storm rolled through and diverted the plane to New Orleans. Not a problem at all since I hate flying when it's just cloudy. Once the storm cleared, the ticketing counter kept us updated on the re-boarding in New Orleans, the wheels being up, and them being halfway through the trip.My issue came when the flight, about 20 minutes to landing in Houston to take us back to St. Louis was suddenly canceled. At this point, it's 1 am and everyone is confused and outraged because the sky is clear. We then find out, the flight crew ran out of flying hours. Seriously!? So, throughout this entire ordeal, which took about 3- 4 hours after the initial boarding time, NO ONE calculated their flight hours until they were getting ready to land?!The icing on the cake was the rebooked flights for layover trips through Dallas to St. Louis the next morning and the hotel voucher that was basically useless! I mean seriously, it's 2 am by this time and we have to be on a flight in literally 4 hours?! In what world does leaving the airport and going to the hotel make any type of sense?We were put on a standby list for the flight that was direct to St. Louis at 5:35 am that morning and because we were in the middle of a connection, we were told we were top priority and pushed above the others who weren't in the middle of a connection. Well, that was also FALSE! If someone had A+ preferred, we were pushed down the list after them even though they weren't in the middle of a connection.The worst part is that after the horrible experience was over and we were finally in St. Louis to collect our bags, EVERYTHING WAS SOAKING WET! Essentially, it seems like during the storm, our bags were left outside unprotected and soaked by the rain. Why in the world would they leave them exposed like that? Everything smelled like mildew and was still wet, so I had to wash the entire contents of our bag and lay the electronics out to dry. Thankfully we had our laptops, but our firestick, chargers, and other things were in there. That alone really pissed me off. I just wanted to shower and change clothes and rest after 24+ hours of DOMESTIC travel that should have only been 12. But no, I had to do Laundry before I did anything else because I had nothing to change into!"
"I have always loved Southwest. I feel like one of those 'loyal to the brand' types of people. They are SO accommodating to families after we had our newborn on 3 flights. If I can fly Southwest, I WILL!"
I can only comment on my situation as we've yet to fly with Southwest.We had a flight booked and early into our US trip received a call from our home that my wife's mother was gravely Ill. We were on a plane 10 hours later going back home.I cancelled Southwest domestic flight same day and later emailed them asking for a refund. I explained in detail the circumstances we were in.They went the extra mile for us and refunded our flight even though they were under no obligation to do so.That small amount was critical at that time as we incurred substantial costs due to cancellation fees and re-booking costs.In light of what happened I can easily give them a 5 star rating.
Their Call Center needs more staffing. Their wait on hold said that we are important to them but the wait to get to a live agent was going to be one to two hours. Contradiction much?
"Poor service. My original flight was to depart at 10:30 PM. I got to the airport a little after 8 PM. Flight 5488 to Atlanta has been delayed more than 5 times with completely unacceptable reasoning in my opinion. I am still sitting in Austin airport while Southwest send updates of delays. You’re updates aren’t helping me, I have back to back meetings starting at 8 AM and currently if this flight doesn’t get pushed back for the 6th time I will currently reach Atlanta at 6:14 AM, not my office where my meetings are held, ATL airport. This is ridiculous. I’ve spoke to many people with no help. This will be my last time flying with southwest, I never had this issue with American Airlines."
Why do I pay to upgrade my seating position so I can enter and exit the flight sooner only to have people from the back shove their way to the front when it’s time to disembark. I’ve flown on a Mexican Airline Volaris where the Captain announces that there is an order to exiting a plane and it’s done by rows!!! He makes everyone remain seated until their turn. People have zero consideration anymore and are treating planes like greyhound buses. There is no flight etiquette. Passengers need to be told!!! Southwest just allows rude passengers to charge from the back to front. It’s so annoying!
"Attention Southwest passengers, please take a moment to read this important message to ensure you don't miss your flight. Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning.To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding.Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again.What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business.To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery. This entire experience has further deepened my dissatisfaction."
THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER CARE. CLEAN AND SANITIZE AIRCRAFT. EXCELLENCE CREW. THANK YOU SOUTHWEST AIRLINES TO BE IN MY TOWN BNA. 🫶❤️
"I think there are some things that they can upgrade, but TSA and security were amazing, and all of the employees were friendly. The thing that I think they can improve is  luggage care. When I was on a plane to KC I saw that the guys who were putting luggage into planes were NOT careful at all, plus this is how they broke my wheel on the suitcase, they tossed it, then the wheel snapped right off. 3/5 for this one."
"I can’t fly to Chicago for two days due to a rescheduled flight!!!for the first time we got on a plane and everyone just dropped us off and said that you were leaving tomorrow! and the next day they promised a direct flight to Chicago, but again they outplayed everything and changed the flight 3-4 hours before departure! Now I need to fly with a transfer to Dallas! I also have my own business, job, family waiting for me at home! I paid money for this! Is this an airline or a taxi on call?! If you are saving your time, don't fly with this airline!!"
"I booked a group travel ticket for 10 people and when I made the reservation over the phone, I paid the required $500 deposit at the same time. After I made the payment, I received an email that the deposit  was non-refundable and I needed to make the final payment by May 2023.  I went in today (5/18/2023) to make the final payment and was told that my reservation was cancelled because I did not make the payment by May 5 and that my deposit was forfeited.  This is a scam - DO NOT make your deposit payment at the same time you make your reservation.  Be sure to obtain the contract before forking out any money and read the very, very fine print carefully and several times.  Better yet, fly a different airline!!"
"I know there are some poor reviews on American local carrier Southwest. But I flow from San Jose to Las Vegas and back on Southwest in the last two weeks, and they were brilliant.The staff are caring and helpful, and they actually socially engage with their passengers. Plus they give you a free drink and snacks on the plane, for a one hour flight  I thought that was fantastic. I'm not even going to say airlines that service UK like Ryanair can learn from them, because I don't think Ryanair wants to learn anything from anyone!.So, southwest thanks for taking us to Vegas and back on your planes, we will definitely fly with you again in future."
"On Sunday, May 14 (Mother's Day) I was researching info for my 2 80+ yearly friends that were flying to Long Beach on Thursday, May 17.  They both had request wheelchairs both directions, but I was trying to find the protocol when they arrived at Long Beach, CA as it doesn't have a pull-up ramp but deplane using stairs.  My male friend will not be able to do that as his legs not strong enough.  KEYSHA, Houston reservationist, did not know , but made several telephone calls  while I was on hold to get the proper information.  Her willingness to go beyond answering the phone; her constant checking to see if I was still on HOLD; and her desire to make sure I received the proper information was so much appreciated.  It is so frustrating not to be able to find the right number to call for my answer, but was relieved to find a person willing to go beyond  Thank you KEYSHA for you help.  FYI, my husband and I have been lucky that all our SW flights have been great and the men at the outside curb-service have been more than wonderful  I recently flew from Cambodia to San Francisco (4/15) and I believe Arthur at curb-service was incredible for me and my 2 friends.  I needed a wheelchair and he ran inside to get one  so I didnt have to stand there.  The 3 of us were so exhausted due to our long flight. Then, I had a wonderful wheelchair assistant to take me the rest of the way.  I have  nothing but positive comments to make about Southwest"
"I was leery about flying SWA after all the cancellations these past holidays. But I decided to give them a chance and my flight to Tampa was totally fine. Even though it was an evening flight, it was only delayed 20 min due to waiting for the plane to arrive. Smooth flight, good staff on board. No issues!"
"Hello readers.This message regarding Southwest Airlines ticket counter extension. I miss my first flight to visit Nashville Tn. So I was put on standby, ones I learned that I was to put on the next. I had to go get my new ticket from the customer service. That’s where I’ll meet Mr. David who was not friendly or nice at all. Mr. David had to re-inform dad how lucky I was that I was not supposed to be on this flight either but someone showed up late as well. My reply was oh I’m so sorry to hear that. Thank you so much for helping me he reply he just make sure you get on this  flight. I’ll reply back to let Mr. David know that I will be sitting here and will not miss this flight. His response was a model silence. For customer service to do their job with a smile on their face when people like myself pay good money to fly with Southwest and get a Southwest experience when we fly south with respect to the customer service skills. Thank you once again, Mr. David."
"Great Job by Ms. Lisa (Lisa51 from Chicago Call center)Lisa from Chicago 51 is the most helpful since i called three times if you look at the log i called from the 1 407 310 7933 to check in - but before that i was not able to logon at the portal i wanted to set upShe was so keen, eager to help as well as resolve.She has the patienceTenacityKnowledgeHighly helpfuloutstanding customer serviceShe is assetthis happened on March 4/27/2023- Thursdayandthe flight crew from Baltimore to Orlando-MCO on 4/28/2023 like people like Stephanie and the crew make a differenceon 5/2/2023 from Nashville, TN to CHS, SC -awesome person at the end- i think it was courtney or i will check out"
"So done with Southwest, booked a flight to Tampa 4/27/23, got a text flight delayed 25 min, ok no big deal, get to the airport, park the car, go through security, get on the tram and by the time I got off the tram another text saying flight was cancelled!!!! Seriously, lame excuse saying problem in Tampa with air traffic control, but funny no other airline cancelled going to Tampa! They rebooked me for 5:45 am next day, should I go next day and have that cancelled too? why and issue one day but resolved next morning? I already had to pay for parking and drive 45 minutes to home again! Now I have to fight for my money back because I used points from another flight I had to cancel due to covid! Of course no one could explain what the problem was in Tampa, typical southwest internal issues that were to be upgraded, but probably were not. I will NEVER  trust them again or fly Southwest, save your selves the aggravation people and use another airline!! Done! I want a check sent for my points! flight confirmation #3VDADL"
"I purchased $1,500 worth of gift cards from a third party for Southwest airlines to use for our honeymoon. When I went online to use the electronic gift cards for the trip we had been looking at, the codes generated by Southwest airlines were no good. You see on Southwest gift cards you need 19 digits they only generated 16 digits so my gift cards were of no use. When I was finally able to get my money back for the gift cards from the original vendor the prices had increased and the promotions had changed. Our original trip to Mexico was going to cost about $700 per person in the trip now is between 1,000 and 1,100. After 2 weeks of trying to reach someone at Southwest that could help me I was told that there is nothing that they can do to honor the price I was going to originally purchase them at. I told them that the error and mistake was on their part and they should be liable and be able to honor the original price we were looking at. They are refusing to help but have the audacity to tell me that I'm a valued customer and that they are more than willing to help me if I agree to play 7 to 800 dollars more for the same trip. With all of the problems Southwest airlines has had in the last 4 to 6 months you think they would try to do a little bit more to help the consumer. Go to Expedia or funjet tours or any other tour company to book your trip."
Southwest can burn in HELL!! I don't see how they are still in business.
"I will never use Southwest Vacations again unless it’s some sort of crazy “travel emergency.” They make it very difficult to change your flight. You can’t do it through SWA & there are change fees. Don’t be deceived.  I think they must be a second party travel agency. The reps are in an outside the US call center & don’t always speak good English. I had to pay for another ticket because I could not just go on the app & change my flight. My trip cost an additional $260!! So, it’s definitely not worth the “savings.” It’s so much better & easier to book through Costco Travel where they actually care about their customers!!"
"Flight delay 2 hours 40 minutes.  Was told by gate agent delay was due to having to wait on connecting passengers the prior flight, so it backed up.  Told to “wait” as they had zero flights via any connections available.  No one announced jack.  Went up to get status and was told no way to get back home for two DAYS.  This is a sunny day on the frickin’ West Coast!  I lost important medical appointment, major business meeting, etc.  The solution was ship me to another AIRPORT at my expense and a hotel at MY expense.  I complained over this and was told it was a “weather” issue and I would not get a voucher for anything!  I told them what the agent told me - a schedule delay on SW’s part…I was of course dismissed.  I am now stuck at a hotel at my expense, moved back to the original airport, two rebooking, and an 8 hour layover tomorrow (hopefully) just to get a total of a three-hour flight back.  There was a lot more.  I will never fly Southwest again, and I plan on filing a formal complaint."
"We had an incident on the flight I was on with an unruly passenger. They handled it with professionalism care for the customers, and considering how awful it was they tried their best to make it better for us. The flight back was beautiful no incidents very good to us. I will only fly Southwest now you guys do a great job."
"Rude staff, constant flight/ gate changes.  Terribly run company"
"After last year's service debacle I was hesitant to fly Southwest again, but I'm glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service. Their Wanna Get Away rates were the best, as always. The check-in people and crew were very friendly and our four flights were all on time.  On our return, we were delayed an hour due to severe thunderstorms in our flight path. That was understandable, but we were late for our connection in Baltimore.  Southwest knew of our problem and held the plane for us and our luggage. We were very happy when our luggage was there when we arrived in Hartford.  But most impressive was the way both return pilots handled the planes as we passed through strong turbulence on both flights. It was rough, but the pilots came through beautifully.  Overall, the experience was very good and my confidence in Southwest is back!"
"This company is awful. Flew to sf for a wedding. Our flight was delayed 4 hrs. No rain no snow, just delayed due to incompetence? Then on the flight back another delay of 2 hours. They didn't have enough overhead bin space for everyone and the ghetto flight attendance started grabbing bags and slamming them in trying to fit things. They broke a souvenir I got... what an awful company. Of all the airlines this had been the worst by far and hope they go under soon."
"The worst customer service I've ever had, from checking in to not getting a drink in time before landing. The flight attendant came and forced me to throw away my unfinished drink that had a lid.Don't fall for the ""free"" it's not worth the circus act. They allow 2 free bags checked in, but if you only have one bag and it's over their weight limit you are charged $75Not worth your time and money. Fly with another company that is up to date on customer service.Hire people that care if you want to keep your customers."
"We were traveling to Florida. to take a cruise when our luggage was delayed on our Southwest flight and forwarded to Birminghm Alabama. as detailed in our report We were delayed so long trying to find our luggage and then completing a report (MCOWN45135309) that we missed our cruise. By the way this was a direct flight from Syracuse to Orlando, we never changed planes.Initially we thought we would have time to gather some belongings as suggested by the baggage manager at southwest and we attempted to do so. If anyone has tried to gather belongings in a strange town and with limited time to buy clothing for 7 days at sea they know this an impossible task, not to mention all our medications were stored in our checked baggage. While looking for some essential items the cruise ship contacted us letting us know they would be closing the doors in 15 minutes and sailing. This was much earlier than expected. We were still 1 hour away and could not make it to the terminal on time. After explaining this to the baggage manager he demanded the compensation check back and booked us on the next flight home. Southwest refuses to compensate us for anything other than 2 pieces of toilet paper callled $200 dollar vouchers. we are out over $5000. After numerous emails and phone calls, updating claims as suggested by the phone rep., Southwest continues to claim we cancelled our vacation! NO, we were forced to cancel due to missing our cruise ship due to thier incompetence. Southwest customer service is below a 1 star and does nothing to help, just puts the blame on the customer continuing to claim we cancelled our trip.... They also hide behind emails so they do not have to deal directly with the customer."
Delays. Constant delays. Told we were leaving several times. Lined up repeatedly just to be informed of another delay.
"The last 2 times we have flown Southwest our return flights have been cancelled, causing us to have to rebook on another airline costing us over 1k each time.  This last time we ever fly with the airline, they delayed our flight 3 times before finally cancelling not allowing enough time to rebook for the same day. They rebooked us 2 days after our original flight stranding us in Orlando, luckily we have friends in the area but cannot say additional days, they cancel leaving their passenger stranded for days needing to find new accommodations.  We gave them a second chance and regret it, they should be reimbursing passengers for stranding them.  All other flights went out just ours was cancelled this is not acceptable, we will be spending all our rewards on other things and shutting our rewards account and credit card down this week. Will NEVER Fly then again."
"I always fly Southwest but lately, i have to admit, I am not thrilled. One would think after the fiasco last December with cancelling a ton of fights, Southwest would up their games, not so. I always pay extra for Early Bird, but Early Bird so it seems does not really get you anything. It is a computerized random selection of how you end up in the line. That is like going to a restaurant, paying for a Steak but you may get hot dog and sausage. The sad part, Southwest at Hobby Airport and at their customer center were completely indifferent. I am not what happens to their leadership at the top, but the lack of it is filtering all the way down to their front line operation. It is not about the $50 but if i wanted to gamble, I would go to a casino, not southwest. I paid for something and I di did not get it; they refuse to refund it, even though I spoke with them before the flight."
"We had to wait an hour for a few people an hour or more. As all the passengers sat around in a full to the brim and I mean FULL, the polite stood around talking and eating snacks. After 1:15 min of waiting in the seats to leave the gate the plane left."
"I used to think very highly of Southwest. They always had great employees and the flights were on schedule. While they still have great employees, I have experienced several significant flight delays over the past six months. As recently as March 6, 2023 we had to deboard a plane for a maintenance issue. Today, March 8, 2023 oxygen masks have to be replenished causing delays. They are now as bad as American Airlines. This is my last flight with Southwest."
My friend Steve was having a couple beers at the bar and they did not let him on his flight. I don’t understand why do they have bars at airports? It’s not like he’s gonna fly the plane what does it matter??
"I have been chasing a refund due from the flight disruption since 12/30/22 and keep getting non-answers from the customer service line. I have tried by phone and by email. Their internal processes are extremely lacking and they don't seem to want to take care of their customers like they used ot.Even though I have tons of points, credits and both myself and my husband are credit card holders for SW, they have lost my patronage after this lack of responsiveness. We'll be taking our business to United. I'd recommend you do the same."
I paid for early bird check in and ended up having to check myself in. I ended up with the same boarding others that flew in the same group as I that didn't pay the extra fee. Customer service pretty much said there is nothing they can do. What is the point of charging an extra fee@Southwest?!
I like to choose my seat I have a problem that the people that choose to bring on large carry onshould seat where they want but wait to get off at the end.then others don't get hurt and we have to wait for our luggage at careacell so they can wait too. They are rude sometimes and don't care. Lock the above luggage holder until every one that doesn't have luggage over head gets off.it used to be small luggage now it's larger suit case. And take a long time to wait. Some of us can't use the rest rooms until we get off so that makes it hard too. Had one woman pushing you back so she can get her luggage that behind her where she sit while we are trying to get off being rude while she could had waited. Making a big sence in front of people pushing me back and putting others people in front of me just being mean. She told me to wait I told her I needed to get to the restroom so she just made it harder for me be cause she was just being mean.
"Called customer service because I tried to upgrade to better seats, the feature didn’t work however it charged me twice without giving me better seats and when I got a rep on the line instead of helping she blamed me and told me to contact my bank for help! How’s that for service?"
"I was at the Clev boarding gates and the gentlemen said my purchased 2nd seat wasn’t printed properly and kept my boarding pass but he would bring it to me once corrected. Got on and the plane nothing to hold my 2nd seat & couldn’t get the attention of the flirty flighty stewardess at the front to advise. Once the plane was COMPLETELY full the guy from boarding gates came and loudly announced to the couple next to me that one of them had to move to another flight due to that seat already being purchased . After they questioned him since they were there and seating is fcfs - he LOUDLY announced Infront of entire plane “it’s because of her size it’s a safety issue”. The entire plane laughed and talked about me the entire flight saying I should have been made to get off. I cried the entire flight home of embarrassment since my weight is due to no thyroid (a MEDICAL CONDITION!) SW promised me a LUV voucher for my “inconvenience” which was routed to the wrong email (not one on my complaint) and then refused to deal with any further . I am advising PLEASE avoid SW if you are of size !! When I flew American in the past , they were much more understanding and private in their interactions about my second seat purchase. SW ruined my self esteem and created any future flying with a  traumatic experience worrying  the same will happen again. SW was very blatant and care less about discriminating against someone of size."
"The flight attendants need to enforce the No saving of seats policy. I purchased early bird seating only to get on the plane and there were at least  20 rows where individuals were saving seats for passengers who were not on the plane yet. This encourages one person to get upgraded boarding, to put things on seats for several others. We had B9 and B10 and could only find two seats together in the second to last row. You do the math. c'mon flight attendants, get a backbone!"
Everything is bigger in Texas. Including the incompetents that now run Southwest Airlines. My wife was flying “business class” when she was left stranded at Dallas Love Field. They changed gates and left her behind. Then put her on standby for the next morning’s flight. No help whatsoever for finding her a hotel. What a joke.
"What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're IN THE AIR to Tampa, citing ""weather"".  After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% ALL OTHER AIRLINES were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality,  there were... TO DENVER! We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And..they weren't canceled!We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board.  From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep.  After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person.  Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight.  There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn’t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport.I don’t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart.  SW used to be my “go-to” airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline’s inconsistency with flights). If you read social media and travel sites, their complaint meter has increased substantially.  If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their “customary playbook” profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important.  They might be forcing people to miss weddings, funerals, births, deaths.  This is not OKAY.  Why would anyone fly them?The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts:  ""Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver...""Southwest cancelled our flight IN THE MORNING and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option.  Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us.  SW does not offer this.   Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly.  We are disgusted with the treatment we received.  They are losing loyal customers left and right.  Why do they keep treating your passengers this way?Shame on you Southwest!"
"The customer service is absolutely the worst. Due to weather issues in Dallas we have been stuck in Phoenix for an extra 4 days so far... They canceled the last flight and rebooked us. I received a text at 2:22am. The flight was at 5:35am day after tomorrow. Had I been sleeping, I would not only not been able to check in 24 hours prior but what was supposed to be a non stop flight they changed to a stop, changing planes and a layover. When I called the agent was so rude."
"This airline has gone from 5 star to 1 or 2 stars in the course of 2 years. On a trip from San Diego to Savannah and back using 2 flights each way, one flight each way was cancelled at the last minute. And this was well before the Christmas meltdown. SW offered to send us a day later - not acceptable and we found another airline at a higher cost due to a last minute fare. On the return they would not rebook us on an alternative route through another city knowing our connecting flight would likely be cancelled. We had to do it ourselves, rebook and cancel our old flights because personnel at the airport counter lied to us and said no alternatives were available. Used to fly them weekly and now will avoid them at all costs."
"Sorry we have been ""inconvenienced by a flight delay?""  REALLY?!!  My daughter and 3 friends boarded a flight to depart at 8:00am.  As of 11:53am they had not left yet.  In the beginning the crew offered $600 to people who could leave the flight.  13 did and then another 9 did.  My daughter and her friends have a connecting flight so they stayed on.  As of 12:30pm they have not left.  They have been offered water once and no snacks which is NOT what your Contingency Plan states at all.  One of the bathrooms has had fecal matter scattered everywhere, by another passenger, including the walls and mirror.  ""US airlines must provide passengers on domestic and international flights with food and water no later than 2 hours after a tarmac delay begins.  The airline is required to keep the lavatories operable....""  At 12:40pm they were told by the flight crew that they could get off the plane for food.  At 12:41 the man who checked their Boarding Passes said no they can't get off because they are about to leave.  They have been detained 5 1/2 hours so far and yet the rules state ""After a tarmac delay of 3 hours in the U.S. or four outside of the U.S., passengers must be given the option to deplane.""  I am furious these young ladies are experiencing this.  At 12:30 I called 800-435-9792 and spoke to Tranail in ""Customer Service"".  He said he couldn't help me but that I should make a complaint so here I am.  I called back to ask for a Supervisor or Manager and was told by Robert that there is no one of any higher level I could speak as they are all out of Dallas.  They only accept emails.  He will try to help me and I have been on hold 19 minutes while tries to reach someone to help me.  WHAT IN THE WORLD KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS?!!!  Zero is what it is.  THIS IS HORRIBLE!  You have in essence kidnapped these passengers and you owe them compensation for the despicable treatment of paying customers.  Lisa finally picked up my call at 1:11pm.  I asked if she was a supervisor and she said no, she's the same as Robert.  There's nothing she can do.  The captain is in charge and then the flight crew.  How do I reach someone higher?  She leads me back to the SW website and the ""Contact Us"" link at the bottom.  Who is going to answer for this shameful behavior?!!"
"The recent incident at Christmas reminded me of a past experience I had with them. I was with my mom in LA and she was being treated for breast cancer. We had to fly back to home and our flight was canceled due to ""bad weather"". We were at the airport and there was hardly anything bad with the weather. Other flights were taking off without disruption. We called the customer service and they refused to do anything about the situation or comp us for an additional night at the hotel. After that I never flew with southwest again."

"Super f@#$&cking delay, was waiting for 10 passengers but after all 10 passengers arrived. 40 minutes later still on the f@#$&cking ground. First time using Southwest and I will never ever use Southwest again. Someone suggested to use Southwest, I shouldn't have listened to that person. Thank Southwest you f@#$&cked up my schedule."
"You stated you're going to do right by your customers.  At first I thought it was a spam email.  I decided to open the email it says we're offering you $250 for reimbursement.  You cant be serious Between booking a flight with another airline (which every airline was price gauging). Between food , hotel & delta airlines flight I spent $2000. I can't believe this SMH."
Absolutely negative. Long story short: Check in lady put the wrong names and city on our bags. Took 2 weeks to locate after multiple phone calls and not one employee was helpful or even cared. Had to purchase everything for work and whatever for 2 weeks. Supposedly found it and Fedexed it. Gave them the hotel address twice and we had to pick it up at a fedex location and miss work 2 days prior to leaving back home on southwest. I have no confidence anyone can do the simplest of tasks. How embarrassing.
"Internet is pretty slow and considering the price of $8; I'd seriously expect better than 3.64 Mbps down and 0.05 Mbps up for $8. Slow for software development (google searches, downloads/installs), browsing twitter, opening a persistent connection. Maybe satellite wifi would help... idk but I'm trying to get done work while on flights."
"Absolutely the worst service I’ve received from any airline. First, my flight on 12/22 was cancelled and rebooked to the 23rd, and again to the 28th. I had to spend over $500 on an emergency flight back home as I had plans for the holiday season. I tried calling Southwest for a refund, and after being on hold for over an hour, they refused to give it to me! Never booking another Southwest flight ever again."
"Audios Southwest!! And for good I am transfering my business, I'm sure along with thousands of others after your 2022 Christmas debacle to an airlines that will, unlike you, earn and deserve my frequent flyer business and not leave me stranded out of state having to rent a car to get home! You don't deserve my business nor will you ever see a penny from me again!! Ever!"
"What an absolute joke. I don’t even know where to begin. This airline needs to be shut down immediately. They say they got their game together by the 2nd of January?! HAAA some continued comedic relief from this joke of an airline. My first flight was canceled in Indy after 3 hrs waiting in the airport then 3 hours on the plane and then disembarking. The next day I was on hold and hung up on by their stellar customer service for about 12 hours of my day. By the next day I was about 50% sure I had rebooked my flight out but obviously couldn’t get ahold of anyone to confirm and had the call dropped during my booking confirmation. By the next day, they had legitimately disconnected their customer service line. So I rented a car and drove 3 hours out of state with the hopes that I had a flight out. Upon arriving here I found out my flight was canceled again and that I was accidentally listed as a ‘no show’ after spending 3 hrs physically sitting on their plane, so I couldn’t be rebooked. No problem, I decided to drive the 18 hrs to my destination since I could no longer stand one more minute of hoping SW would throw me a bone. Now it’s been 9 days and I get to the airport in the hopes of flying home only to find out that without my consent SW had canceled my flight home and not only was I not refunded but I had to buy an additional ticket at the counter for a flight I’d already paid for making me almost miss this flight since even the counter agent couldnt understand what was going on with my ticket. I have a torn MCL and had to run the length of an entire airport to try to make this flight I had just booked. I’ve now paid for 3 flights with SW of which I’ve yet to fly any. I am a rapid rewards member and I have a SW credit card and compassion pass and at this point I want to cut all and any ties linking me or my money or time to this absolute circus of an ‘airline’. You don’t deserve any loyalty. You failed and you continue to fail."
"Over the last 6 or 7 years I've  hung In there . Things can't get any worse. Right. Thought it was management shift or something? NOPE, I WAS WRONG. When I've observed parents and their sick babies (ear trouble, tummy air sickness) getting poor treatment from stewardesses,  other passengers pitching in to help. That was the last straw. Are they afraid of getting barf on their uniform? I felt so bad for the children. Arrogance and greed."
"Southwest Airlines change their name to Southwest nowhere, or we don't give a damn, how can you be bumped seven times in one day trying to get a flight will never use Southwest again"
"I and my wife aged 70+ were travelling from Raleigh to Buffalo on 22nd Dec 2022 by Southwest airlines. All the flights were cancelled to Buffalo, and the only option was to travel to Syracuse via Baltimore. The 2 checked in bags containing our winter clothes, our life saving diabetic medicine (Rublesus) and gifts for granddaughter whom we were meeting after 3 years were supposed to be in the same flight to Syracuse. The flight for Syracuse from Baltimore was initially scheduled at 5:30 PM which was delayed for no reason but to pick up passengers from other connecting flights. The flight to Baltimore actually left at 2AM on 23rd Dec. I had to request my son to drive from Beamsville to Syracuse. The bags did not arrive, and we filed a lost baggage claim.6 days later still don’t have our bags, nor can get anyone to answer the phone. Unless they compensate those, who got screwed out of missing Christmas with family, lifesaving medicines, presents that are in suitcases that have vanished, I will never fly this airline again and not recommend anyone to fly. Southwest, take a small fraction of the millions of dollars you make off of us every year and do the right thing. If you care. Also make the compensation quicker to save some family bonding."
Cancelled flight with no notice and a 3-day layover. All preventable.
"Life long traveler of Southwest. Done with them after the Christmas debacle which left us stranded and unable to see family. 5 days later still don’t have our bags nor can you get anyone to answer the phone. Unless they compensate those who got screwed out of missing Christmas with their family, presents that are wrapped in suitcases that have vanished, I will never fly this airline again. Southwest, take a small fraction of the millions of dollars you make off of us every year and do the right thing. If you care."
Cancel my flight and poor service
"For every ticket holding southwest customer there are people suffering because Southwest, not the weather, is a failure on all levels. They are a terrible airline and I hope there is a huge class action lawsuit against them."
"LIARS! Cant performPassengers started left and right. Its not weather people, its staffing!!!!"
I am losing thousands of dollars due to Southwest Airlines cancelling my flight this morning at 0300 on 12/27 for my flight on 12/29/2022 at 0612 to Dallas the. On to Sacramento. I don’t know that I will ever trust this airline again. I want them to reimburse me for all the money I’m losing not being able to work and no flights through the new year. Very poor service.
"1.  FIRE THOSE IN CHARGE OF THIS AIRLINE2.  LIKE THOUSANDS, THIS AIRLINE (NOT THE WEATHER) RUINED MY CHRISTMAS3.  $200 VOUCHER FOR THE MISERY YOU HAVE PUT US THROUGH???  ARE YOU SERIOUS??  WHO WANTS THIS ANYWAY?  ONLY THE STUPID WOULD EVER USE THIS AIRLINE AGAIN.4. WHERE THE F*^& IS MY LUGGAGE?5.  WHO'S PAYING FOR THE COST OF THE CONTENTS OF MY LOST LUGGAGE?  INCLUDING IRREPLACABLE CLOTHING AND CHRISTMAS GIFTS?6.  WHO'S PAYING FOR THE MULTIPLE TIMES I'VE DRIVEN BACK TO DIA?7.  WHO'S PAYING FOR LOST WORK TIME TRYING TO FIND MY LUGGAGE?8.  PLEASE PUBLIC AND WORLD - TAKE THIS AIRLINE DOWN ONCE AND FALL FOR DOING THIS TO ALL OF US - GO UNITED, DELTA, FRONTIER....ANY ONE IS BETTER THAN THIS SHOTTY CARRIER!!"
"Despite the fact that Southwest cancelled three attempted flights to see my daughter and granddaughter for Christmas, the staff at SAT airport went above and beyond to try to help me get to Indy.  Of particular note was Briana at the ticket counter.  She was getting off shift at 12:30 am, but stayed with me getting another flight that was also ultimately cancelled.  Still the SWA staff were great!"
"The slogan ""bags fly free"" becomes irrelevant when the passengers not their bags ever board the airplane. My sister was planning a visit, over the course of 5 days they cancelled 6 of her flights to the point she had to give up. Canceling one flight is frustrating but sometimes unavoidable, rebooking a customer on another flight only to cancel it as well is madding and shows a lack of planning, repeating this cycle 6 times revels the utter incompetence of this airline. They over sell, over book and have no plan B. They are clearly unequipped to handle any hiccups and rather than having a contingency plan in place for mishaps they completely melt down."
"One flight was canceled without any reason given.  Another flight was delayed but not canceled.  Minors were on board.  When mother attempted to get gate pass, staff told her there were no flights and were extremely rude."
They canceled my flight. I am unable to reschedule a new flight on their website or app and their customer service number has been busy for the past 2 hours.
"Very disappointed and dissatisfied as a customer with SW (waiting for customer service for almost an hour no answer)Flight 2TZEE4 Orlando to Austin canceled my family traveling from PR stucked in airport with no options because you have no pilot to complete this trip in the middle of the holidays. The service has become very poor.  Chat, phone calls and most important -flights.  There is no money back that will fix the problem. No idea why you guys offer money back, or to buy with another airlines when for these days every flight is full and booked. I am so dissatisfied that words will never expressed the magnitude of my disappointment"
"I wish I could give them 0 stars, worst customer service I’ve ever had. Been on hold for over 5 hours and counting. They cancelled our fist flight, then rebooked us and took away the early boarding we paid for, then cancelled our second flight 5 minutes before we were supposed to take off. The customer service was so bad and so rude, they told us we had to call because they had too many people in line. Again, we’ve been on hold for 5 hours and counting, still haven’t been able to talk with anyone, been cut off several times. We spent over $900 on these tickets and cannot get any service. So disappointed, this was my first time attempting a flight with southwest and I will certainly never fly with them or try to again. This is absolutely ridiculous."
I would give zero stars if I could horrible customer service I have been delayed in more than one state F you southwest f you south West f you southwest
"Southwest cancelled my flight and took it upon themselves to rebook me for another flight scheduled for 3 days later. When I called to request a refund not only was I on hold for almost two hours, I was told that I could only get flight credit. Why should I only get flight credit when I paid for a flight to depart on December 23 and was not given one. Southwest stole my money! I paid for something that was not provided I should be entitled to a full refund given that I did not get what I paid for. What’s to stop Southwest from canceling every one’s flight every day and forcing them to get a credit. I don’t want a credit. I don’t want to ever fly Southwest again. I don’t need a credit. I need my money back since Southwest couldn’t deliver what I paid for. Southwest can’t keep my money. That is stealing!"
Would like to commend Charlie on flight 1399 from Love Field to BWI on 12/19. My wife is in a wheelchair and Charlie went above with the care he took care with my wife on boarding and on exiting the aircraft.
Southwest needs more staff to help people with disabilities. I was traveling from Oklahoma to Arizona. And there was only one person on the plane working that could help us. His name was Shawn. If it wasn't for him we wouldn't have made it up the 2 new uphill high ramps and to baggage claim. He was a god sent. He was also help another woman that had dementia and pushing her as well. So he had to push two wheelchairs at the same time with no help. Southwest needs to hire more people as soon as possible or make it so the families can come and assist their family getting off the plane. I was on Fight 1471/ Gate B on Dec 12 the 2022.
"On a long flight from MSP to Denver on Nov 21st, I asked the older, heavy set FA (Lindsey/Leslie?) for 2 beers.  She got rude saying ""I will get you one and see how you do"" in front of my 25 y/o son.  I was stunned. Then she condescended: ""Do you have a problem with that?""  I didn't answer because I thought she was baiting me into an argument.  When we landed, I told the Pilot (Sean) about it.  He agreed she was being rude and said he would talk to her."
"I bought three tickets for myself and two others. The system put one person’s ticket on another flight. This person has never flown before. I explained this to Southwest customer service, and they wouldn’t waive the change fee. I then sent an email to Executive Office, and I am still waiting for a response. This airline has terrible customer service, and I will never fly them again. The charged me $160 to change a $168 ticket. I WILL TAKE ANY OTHER AIRLINE BUT SOUTHWEST!!!"
"Two nights ago I paid $1200.00 for a round trip ticket to Atlanta for 11/22/22 returning to Seattle 11/29/22. I arrived in Denver 12:30 pm with a connection to Atlanta at 5pm. I have paid for a rental car and hotel. Unbeknownst to me the flight was changed from gate C 61 to gate C 47 10 minutes after the boarding was to take place, I inquired and was told that the flight changed to C 47 which was a 3-4 minute walk and that they would phone ahead to let them know that I was on the way. When I arrived I was told that the flight had departed. That the only thing available was at 5:00am. I asked for a complimentary room, I was denied. I called customer service and was told that I would receive a call in 16 minutes. That call back came in 33 minutes and I had to wait on hold another 12 minutes before a live person came on the phone. All she could do was say I am sorry. My wife and I have been loyal Southwest Customers over 20 years. A few years ago Southwest bumped me for a lady with a dog at least that time they provided a room for overnight convenience. While writing this review I was told that someone canceled on Flight 1679 to Atlanta. Told him that I would take it. Hopefully I can retrieve my luggage. They more than likely bumped someone else it strange that I got a Business Select seat A-10"
"I bought a RT ticket, flew in time and emailed them that their website was down and wouldn't let me officially register for the 3 month companion promo - figuring customer service would honor it after I made sure I purchased everything on time. They did not, told me it was basically my fault for their website not allowing for sign up."
"I was considering switching to Delta Airlines. Then I jumped on a Southwest Flight with my husband for our honeymoon. The flight attendants were so kind and personally congratulated us. They then proceeded to announce congratulations on the overhead speakers. The whole plane clapped. No other airline has this type of personal touch. Thank you, Southwest."
"Absolutely the only way to fly...Booked a flight to Ft Lauderdale from Austin a couple of weeks ago. Had trouble getting a rental car so so I thought I should reschedule the flight. Called customer service less than 24 hours before my flight to change it. I was able to make the change with no extra charges or fees. $167 rtWhen I got on the plane there were two women seated in the 1st row so I sat in the middle seat. First time in my life that I was the first passenger off a plane.Why would anyone fly with any other airline? Free checked bags, great friendly customer service, no charge for changes, credits and points no longer expire.Southwest you raise the bar for air travel!"
"Hello. Southwest Airlines doesn't have assigned seats. You check in. And based on how early you check in; or if you have other perks; you're on the plane sooner than others. So why do the flight attendants hold rows of seats by literally putting their knees on the seats blocking access to sit? If I'm in B; I shouldn't have to sit in the back of the plane (if I don't want to; or if other seats are available closer), because you want someone in C who checked in later to sit closer. Date of experience was September 30 2022."
"I have 2 different flights this month.  My daughter lost her ID and couldn't get on the flight so I booked her a hotel room.  The attendant told me she just didn't want to fly and charged me for the difference.  I booked my other flight 4 months in advanced, and need to come back a day earlier.  The attendant wants to charge me 185.00 to change my flight from a Tues to a Wed.  No bargain with these charges."
"So they have this rule that if you purchase a ticket for a companion the name can’t be changed. This is such a stupid rule. If I payed with MY money, I should be able to have all form of credit under my name.Will never use this company again! I’ve been using delta for years and they are definitely the number 1 company. No stupid rules!"
"We attempted to book a flight from BWI to Indianapolis for Sunday, October 16, 2022 and wanted to use miles.  We were in the process of putting in the information to purchase the ticket and got a notice that we needed to purchase additional miles.  We purchased $345 in additional miles to have enough for the ticket and then continued to enter the rest of our information for the ticket.  When we clicked purchase, we got an error message and it said to call the airline.  Upon speaking with a Southwest Airlines representative, we were told that the flight was now sold out.  So frustrating.  We then asked for our money back for the miles we could no longer use and were told that they were non-refundable.  Apparently Southwest thinks it's ok to spend $345 and not even get a ticket for it.  When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told that they would forward my ""case"" to Corporate Customer Relations and that we'd hear from them in 10-12 business days.  We just received a call from a Customer Relations representative and all he did was explain that he wouldn't refund the money and that it was their policy.  The entire process is a bait and switch and should be banned.  Southwest Airlines should stop these fraudulent practices and refund customer's money when they can't give them a ticket.  We plan to avoid Southwest Airlines whenever we can.  Watch out."
"I just got back from a flight/hotel with Southwest to Vegas.  I was going with my daughter who is from Austin. I flew from Love Field in Dallas to Austin.  Then met her and we flew on to Vegas.  The flight was OK but we had to sit across from each other and barely talked because of the noise. But when we got to Vegas we stayed at the MGM Grand bc we had stayed there many years ago and my daughter wanted to stay in the same hotel we had stayed in before. This time MGM was just awful..The carpet was filthy, the bathtub stopped up or toliet stopped up as well. My son had met us there and flew American. They both got mad and left me in Vegas all alone. The reason I even tell you this is because I thought I had lost my phone and was desperate in Vegas. So it was late at night and they left, I went to a security guy to see if he could help me and he flat said no.  I was shocked.  How unfriendly can anyone be even when a 71 year old woman is in deep trouble and he does nothing to help in any way.  It was so sad and so shocking.  Finally a nice lady in line waiting to speak to the front desk clerk let me call my husband.  I still cannot believe how bad it was. But then when I went to check out I found out that when you book a travel package with SW there is always an additional $40 per night that you are charged for nothing I mean nothing. They call it Resort Fees!!! No it was more like robbery fees.  They just robbed me of $120 for a filthy room that cost me for a package deal of $2359.00 plus the $40 a night for resort fees.   A bunch of crap.  I went to Oklahoma and got a brand new rood free for two nights that were just wonderful. That was what made us want to go to Vegas. My husband and I used to go to Vegas at least 3 times a year and stay in many hotels and he said they were always nice and never had heard of Resort Fees.  Never again will I ever step foot in any resort that MGM Grand owns.  Worst experience."
"They canceled our flight this morning. They gave us 3 more flighs but at the end all of them were full, didn't have any sits for us. Now they gave us another (flight) at 8:50 pm. Let's pray that southwest don't cancel again.They play with the customers' time.I hope never book with this company any more."
Simultaneously checked in with my 12 year and so daughter who is assigned end of C and myself end of A. The next message asks me to pay money to upgrade her. Talked to three southwest employees who would not let her board with me. We were separated in the Dallas airport causing a lot of stress. Will be changing airlines.
"They are better since COVID.I used to not care for the way they ran things before but I feel like they have it together now. I like the free seating, though I REALLY wish they'd be a bit more proactive about telling people when it's a full flight (they do that part) and asking people to scoot in rather than soooo many couples taking the window and isle hoping no one asks to sit there, or the solo person who sits on the isle and is offended when asked if others could sit there too. It's not their fault some people are selfish, but I feel like they should say something. If we nothing is said, they'll keep thinking it's ok. We're all in this together, it's not going to hurt you to allow someone to sit next to you for a few hours, you know it's going to happen anyways, you're just making everyone think you're a jerk. I feel like there is also enough room for everyone's bags as well. I haven't seen someone have to gate check something in a while.Also, if you hate being in the mid-low C's and being seated separately, it is worth the $30 for the business upgrade. I've started getting it on all my business trips and it's a lot less stressful.I greatly appreciate the sense of humor I feel the SW staff and pilots have. LAS to RNO was COMPLETELY enjoyable."
"Breeze is better, less crammed and dingy. Equal service. Less changing flights and gates. Mess in Washington/Reagan Airport"
"I have to say, as someone who has seen the mess across the travel industry this summer, SW seems to be doing the best they can and are a mediocre experience in a sea of terrible experiences. Their customer services is helpful most of the time, but hopefully they can hire more people because these staffing shortages are hard for everyone."
"I’ll start with arriving to MBJ @ 9a for a 12p flight to MCO- the system was down & it took over 2 hours to get through what started as short line but the agents kept opening other lines to skip newly arriving ppl to the ticket agents b/c the line was too long into the way of walking traffic. This caused major wait time in line AND once boarded. It’s unbelievable that we waited ON THE PLANE for 1 person to finally board which took 1 hour 15min THEN another 45min for clearance from someone to go ahead & take off. You’d think the airline would rather save money and time by taking off without that 1 person b/c most of us had connecting flights that had to be rescheduled due to the 2 hour delay. Some flights had to be rescheduled until the next day, all for waiting on 1 passenger who could’ve actually made it onboard the next flight. Wait, there’s more- worse… there was a passenger seated directly behind me who wanted to please himself sexually with no regard of passengers around him & he jumped up right as we landed which caused the plane to completely stop without going to the gate for deplaning. After they got him to come out the restroom & they sat him closer to the front next to a man (thankfully) and we proceeded to gate but was instructed to remain seated until he was escorted off and then the lady sitting next to him was escorted off as well. Horrible right? Last, I’ll insert the flight attendant Wendy was rude! Ignored me each time I made a request. I requested a cup of ice & she ignored me & never brought me any ice. Oh yeah, they threw me in position C Boarding after I paid for the business select fare & when I mentioned it to the manager at MCO, he told me he’d be wrong if he moved my position up to skip someone else. Really????? Started at the airport at 9a & my rescheduled connecting flight to DAL is delayed 45min (was scheduled to depart at 7:45p) and it’s 8:27p and we are just now pulling from the gate. Still not home in Dallas."
I usually love southwest and just purchase the want to get away ticket. Never had any issues until today. I found out they added a new tier a month ago called want to get away plus and I could not do a free same day flight change like usual without paying $127. It is about $20 more for the plus. I feel like they should give people a grace period in adopting this new tier since I was told it was a recent addition. So upset and out $127 which could’ve just been $20. Corporate greed at its finest probably since the founder passed away.
"Forget you southwest. I’ve been at the airport on a layover for 9 hours now that was supposed to be 1 hour. Swear, the delays, terrible customer service, and layovers I’m so done with this company. I’ve been using you since college and I’ve continued to because of the points I’ve accrued over the years. I’m tired of being forgotten after all I’ve poured into your company. I gave you my trust and you’ve given me bull crap in response. Goodbye and good riddance."
"I am still waiting for a final response that I assume will not come... I had a 6:20pm flight that was canceled by SW for ""operational"" reasons about 4 hours before take off.  It was NOT weather or maintenance related!  It became obvious that I was either going to be stranded in KC, Chicago, or Nashville on Aug. 29, 2022, and I only wanted to know if SW was going to cover my lodging/food expenses until I got back to CLT.  The phone rep kept saying ""I think this"" -""I think that,"" but would/could not provide a straight answer.   After almost an hour on the phone with no assurances, I purchased a ticket on another airline to get back to CLT.    If SouthWest is going to refuse to reimburse me for the ticket, then surely they should provide me with the funds that they would have had to cover for the cancelation (1-night lodging, 2 meals), but nope..... Nothing!  They simply credited back points for that 1-leg of the trip. They ignored the $ I paid to get to KC on SW.   I truly can't understand how these companies get away with jamming people with unforeseen expenses with zero accountability when they fail for ""operational"" reasons.   I would have been satisfied even had they paid me $150 of the $450 ticket I had to buy on AA to get home.  Again, not canceled because of weather or maintenance.  I tracked all SW flights that evening and had I not bought that ticket on AA, I would have been in fact stuck in Chicago or Nashville with zero assistance from Southwest!Southwest Airlines will leave you and your family stranded with zero accountability.  Sure, they will say ""I am sorry your experience has been poor,"" but try tucking those words under your head when trying to sleep as you wait 24 hours to get home!I can only hear my grandfather saying ""you get what you pay for!"""
This is the first time I travel with Southwest and my experience is for transportation taking my customers back and fort to Denver International Airport now for any one who travels with Southwest is better for you to confirm your tickets over the phone they are every lineant when it comes to people boarding I always recommend it to my Customers the only thing I will say is that Southwest seems to be over booking and when you show up to the counter they ask if you have purchased your ticked and I can say that the ladies were saying that I was late or missed the flight I checked my bags at 4 am flight didn't leaved until 5:35 am and the lady at C59 send me to C28 with that said make sure your tickets are confirmed and plan on traveling ahead of time
After flying with the other airlines I am amazed at how tremendous this airline is. More than I could of imagined. Y’all make everyone else look like amateurs! They are so accommodating with great smiles to go with their amazing personalities.I fly twice a week for work and I’m usually stressed out wondering if I will get to work on time & emotionally wiped out after my travel days….this crew made me so comfortable and relaxed….No worries at all!A great big shout out to Southwest!!!❤️
"I'm writing this from the runway, having sat here for an hour and a half. They boarded the plane without having pilots. Because of that, they couldn't turn the plane on, meaning no air despite it being 90 degrees outside. After 20 minutes when the pilots showed up, the air came on but they had a maintenance problem. That took half hour, then there was another unspecified delay for another half hour - all the while telling us every 20 minutes ""we are almost ready, any minute.""Why would you board a plane before the pilots were even at the airport? Why would you keep people on a hot plane without air instead of in the terminal? Why would you board a plane before checking it for maintenance?This used to be the best airline, before they got billions in taxpayer money as a bailout supposedly for staffing retention.Even 2 years after that bailout, they are still canceling and delaying flights constantly and lying about weather EVERY TIME when there isn't any. It's always staffing and they always lie. They have delayed or cancelled 4 of my last 5 flights.This company is no better than the rest. It does not deserve your business, as they will ALWAYS put profit over service."
Your dont deserve 1 star because your flight is always delayed every time i have this airline
"Major late cancellations & delays on round trip flights from Houston to Baltimore on 8/11. Attending a wedding in PA so Had to rebook out of Austin-drove all nite to make 5:10 flt out of Austin-Baltimore to have it delayed to 8:30.Tried to change & rebook in Baltimore for our return flight to Austin bc that’s where our car was now @ airport parking. No help @ SW ticket agent-had to spend several hrs next day to change our flight bk to Austin. Return flight was aweful too! Arrived @ Baltimore @ 4:15 for 8:00 pm flight-delayed until almost 11:00 pm due to mechanical issues, concourse & crew changes etc etc etc. Horrible service! SouthWorst! Plus’s my nice suitcase was all torn up when it arrived in Austin! 😖😖😖"
This airline use to do no wrongBut lately it is total shxt!Late take offsPoor boardingUnorganized
"Flew out of Nashville to our destination in Minneapolis. When we arrived, our clothing was completely soaked. We had a hard plastic suitcase, so we didn’t notice at the time. When we got to the hotel, we had to wring out our clothing and hang them all over the hotel. The following day, we had to visit a laundromat instead of attending to our travel plans. We were then informed that you only have a 4 hour window to report damage. Since we landed very late at night and had to deal with wet clothing, we missed our “window” to report the damage. Thanks for ruining our trip Southwest. Unbelievably terrible!"
"I Love Southwest Airlines and always go to them first when I travel. However, Flight #2868, from Orlando to Dallas Love, 08/07/22, was the worst southwest flight that I have been on. The stewardesses were horrible! The front attendant seemed more concerned about her hair and at first, I didn't know that she was. My wife needs assistance, and on all other flights that we have taken, the flight attendant has ALWAYS helped her board and leave the plane. This lady stood and watched and did not greet nor offer any help. As far as beverages, my wife had to stop another attendant and ask for one.As I stated earlier, I love SWA, but I hope this is not the caliber of people they are hiring.My Flight to Orlando on 08/03/22, Flight #2781 was EXCELLENT. The crew Highly, showed what made SWA one of the better arlines"
"The southwest open seating is a disaster in it causes havoc during boarding, Why they don't do away with this system is beyond me.Second issue was with a female flight attendant that was actually the skinniest of the all flight attendants on my flight.I had a cut on my right elbow and tried to get a left isle seat as to not have my right elbow exposed but we all know about murphy's law so i get the right isle seating.My right elbow was a very little over the right armrest and every time she walked by guess what she ran into it no apologies or effort to avoid my elbow with a bandage on it.At the end of the flight i asked her for her ID she asked for the reason when i responded that i will be leaving a review she asked me if there was a problem i was honest and explained the issue to her she informed me that she can not show me her ID but her name was liz and look up the flight number and complain."
"We were on holiday, one week in NY, the other one in Florida. When we arrive in La Guardia Airport we discover that our flight was deleted, NOBODY TOLD US ABOUT THIS!!! NO SMS, NO EMAIL, NO POPUP NOTIFICATION.The guy at the Southwest desk tell us: you flight tomorrow, La Guardia / New Orlenas, New Orleand / Tampa. WHAT?? We booked a direct flight NY / Tampa, and now we flight the day after?Reason of Southwest: The weather.They always says the weather, because they have his ass covered.We decided to refund our ticket, and rent a car. We asked clear for a *refund*. After 5 days we discover that is not a refund, but a credit with southwest. Are you kidding? We clearly told you that we are italian and we didn't care about a credit, and you gave us a credit?After that I spoke on Twitter with southwest staff and they gave me the refund.But they ruined our holiday, we spent a lot of money for a last minute car. NO WORD.I flew (before covid) with southwest and was a great company, for this reason I booked again with them. BIG MISTAKE."
I use to be a Southwest warrior but have to say the only thing they do consistently is delay and cancel their flight.  Cash in points and avoid them like the plague.  If you want to be left at the airport or sit through numerous delays Southwest is your airlines.
"I first flew with them in December of 2021 when I went to visit my girlfriend in Rochester NY. For starters the prices of their fares simply cannot be beat! Two free checked bags and two free carry on's per passenger just sweetens the deal! No assigned seating? YES PLEASE! Just booked a flight for me and my daughter to fly up to Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with family and round trip for both of us was only $715.96 where as any other airline would have cost us over $1,100 just for Economy! The staff is some of the friendliest I've come across and the flights were comfortable. While they don't fly into every airport at this time they are making strides to do so! Will continue to use them! If you are looking for a more affordable alternative I recommend giving Southwest a Chance, I'm glad I did!"
Please don't hire those that act like children at the Hilo International airport customer service desk. My goodness those girls are so very ghetto!
"If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  My college student canceled a flight to see his grandfather after he was tested positive for COVID.  I rebooked his flight so he could fly home at the end of his academic year.  His flight was canceled.  Since my son was flying home for an internship meeting with a delivery company (he's a logistics major) he could not be late and his original flight gave him just enough buffer.  So I asked Southwest what I should do with the unused ticket - it was originally booked in June and the flight was in April.  My son was most likely not going to fly until the school year.  I was told to make a request to SW right at one year of the original booking date.  Not a problem, until I called to ask how to do it and was told ""This is a request - we do not have to honor it.  You would get 18 months from the original booking date.  And you have to pay a $100 change fee.""  Which I repeatedly pointed out - you canceled my son's flight.  So I put this into my e-mail on 5/11/22.  On 6/1/22, I was told I was going to receive a voucher for the $211 I paid.   On 8/16, i decided to call because my voucher was not received,  My son was flying within the week for an interview and I could use that ticket.  Following the directions on the website that says ""If you are flying within a week, call us at xxx"".  So I did.  I was told the voucher was e-mailed, and they could do nothing to help me even though my son was flying within a week.  They told me to e-mail again and wait for the response in about 7-10 business days.  Again, I pointed out that he was flying within a week - that was too late.  No there are no supervisors; this is corporate, all I could do is e-mail.  And why didn't I just book him on an earlier flight?  Because he had finals and was running to make his meeting.  I was then told that even though the clock was ticking, my exp date would not change.  Flights opened up on 6/9 and I saw my son's potential flight to use this ticket from school go up steadily each day.  To add insult to injury, I was told this is a voucher and I can give it to someone else to use for a vacation.  To which I pointed out we are in a 9.1% inflation period - are they paying for my vacation?  So I e-mailed and waited again.  Then on 6/28, I was told that the voucher went out on 6/16 (although 2 other persons said it went out on 6/1) and to wait another 10 business days.   So I did and of course nothing happened.   So I did what my lawyer, and retired SW pilot told me to do: file a claim.  And keep sending over e-mails on a daily basis.  I did that on FB and through their site,  Their site said ""THis is definitely a concern.   We will get back to you in about 30 days.""  FB answer was - this is a concern and we are turning this over to a specialized group.   Purely disgusted, I took off from work on 7/19.  I first called Delta about some tickets   Off the phone within 15 minutes - received my refund within 2 hours via email.  Then called SW.   Was on the phone for 2 hours.  Finally, Jacalyn, a semi supevisor, said she would get IT to check into this.  IT could find no reason why my e-mail was not going through but admitted that something was wrong; they would send me my voucher,  I should receive it by 7/23.  Then on 7/22, I get a vms from Martha goode at SW.   They cannot send me a voucher - I would receive it via e-mail within 10 business days.  Her mistake - she left a phone number.  I left her a message askingher - well if this did not work for the last SEVEN weeks, what is going to be done when this time fails also?   And I e-mailed this.  Also, I called her today (7/25) every hour leaving a vms as to what were the plans?  SW was obviously running down the clock - already 7 weeks elapsed on using my voucher and my son's targeted ticket doubled in price - well more than my voucher.  Miracle of miracles, SW e-mailed me my vouher.  There was no problem with my e-mail; I could tell they never sent it.  And when they had to put a value on THEIR time, they finally did what they should have done in the first place.  I used to love SW, but they have demonstrated that they lie, cheat and steal from their customers.  If they stood behind their promises, I would have gone back.  It was never the money - this is pennies to what we pay in flights - but the absolute disregard for their customer which proves how they earned their nickname Southworst.    Even with all the problems, not one other airline has given me an issue and specifically REPEATED ISSUES ON THE SAME PROBLEM.  You really should be ashamed of yourselves thinking you provide any iota of customer service.  And yes, I have copies of over 20 e-mails I wrote to you, dates and times already bundled up to send to your corporate office. A certified copy was sent to the Department of Transportation by my lawyer, the retired SW pilot.  Do yourself a favor: book your flight with ANYONE else.  You will thank me for this later."
"My flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto a flight  that was 5 hours later. They had us board the plane where we sat for over 2 hours before the pilot came out to tell us that he was waiting for someone’s luggage before he could take off. He mentioned that we would not get drinks or snacks cause the flight was a short flight. I have pictures on my phone if the flight attendant sitting on the pilots lap in the cockpit. The pilot and his lady friend were both dismissive and rude to anyone who asked any questions. I asked if we could have some snacks while we wait and the pilot asked to see me by the cockpit. He walked me to the entrance of the plane where he told me to turn my phone off and proceeded to yell at me. He told me that he would have me arrested the second that plane landed if I opened my mouth at all during the flight. He told me he would have me banned from ever flying southwest again. I am an attorney so I said ‘I understand that all tickets are revokable’ and explained that I did not intend to offend him at which time he told me to go to my seat and if he heard that i opened my mouth to speak to a fellow passenger or to his staff that there would be ‘hell to pay’ needless to say I sat down and did not move until I landed 11 hours after the time I was supposed to land. I have been a southwest card member and have flown southwest numerous times. I have also flown on other airlines. This was the single worst travel experience I have ever had. This pilots behavior was UNCONSCIONABLE and INAPPROPRIATE and it is clear that if he did this to me, he has done this before. I am not trying to make this into a gender thing but I am a 5 foot 4 small framed lesbian woman and the pilot was a 50 year old larger white man. I don’t think it is a coincidence that he picked me to verbally degrade and berate. It in no way seemed outside his comfort zone which is really scary. I will delete my credit card and never fly southwest again."
"Southwest claims to be open seating but they aren't. On my recent trip to LV I watched people reserve seats for others on all 4 flights. It's quite obvious one person upgraded to A seating and saves seats for the rest of their party. When I inquired with SW they told me that this was okay and condoned this behavior. Now I know how to scam the seating system and save a ton of money. Just purchase one A seat, and save seats for the rest for my party. Thanks SW for saving me money on my travels. Here is the response to my inquiry, I will be carrying a copy of this response just in case a flight attendant tells me I cannot save seats:""Dear Paul,Thank you for taking the time to contact us. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.I regret to hear of your disappointment on your most recent flight back to Philadelphia. All flights on Southwest are ""open-seating,"" and Customers are free to take any available seat onboard the aircraft. Understandably, Customers want to sit by their friends and family members and enjoy each other’s company. Our Flight Attendants typically don’t prevent Customers from saving seats for their friends and family members unless it interferes with our boarding process. Our hope is that early boarding Customers will not save too many seats for their traveling companions as it can be frustrating to a Customer when his/her seat of choice is being saved. Our open-seating policy comes with good points and challenges, and I am sorry you were disappointed with the handling of this particular situation.Your patronage means the world to us. We realize that it can take only one unpleasant experience to reposition our Company in a Customer’s mind, and our genuine wish is that you will not allow this occurrence to forever diminish your impression of Southwest Airlines. We hope to welcome you onboard another Southwest flight soon as we are certain more favorable circumstances will prevail.Sincerely,Alexis MartinezSouthwest Airlines"""
Worst airline ever! They delayed for 4 hours and made me miss my brothers wedding. I will never fly with them again.
"We received notification that our flight was changed from 7/5/22 at 715pm to 7/6/22 at 640am due to inclement weather in Chicago.  Therefore, we had to find a hotel to stay in and extend our rental car an extra day. When we first called SWA the person that answered the phone said go to the airport and they would give us a voucher for a hotel room.  Therefore, we went to Myrtle Beach airport, explained the situation and was turned away by two different airport agents, saying we do not provide vouchers for that and they acted as if they did not care.  Therefore,  SWA was called a lady named Adrianna employee #29 was the only one that seemed to care about our inconvenience and even gave us a $150 love voucher towards our next flight for the inconvenience.  Although it did not cover the extra cost we had to pay for an extra night in a hotel, extra day of car rental and loss wages from the next day.  It was something and at least she showed understanding and compassion.  For this the Racy-McClinton family will be forever thankful."
"Try to avoid this airlines.Extremely rude service....they did not even give water when the flight was late. No apologies , nothing.....very arrogant service."
I love southwestern airlines but I am here very disappointed with one guy I just spoke to on phone yesterday(06/16/2022 at 11 am Eastern time).I wanted to make changes on my booking and he just hanged on me.What is that? Poor customer service.
"We love Southwest Airlines. Not always the people traveling on them, but the Airline has not failed us yet. Companion pass members for over 5 years now.Would LOVE it if they went to Alaska! =)Cons:I do not always agree with how people are able to ""preboard"". They have all found ways to cheat the system, and SW doesn't seem to put their foot down. I wish this would change/get better.The excessive amount of pets allowed is a bit out of hand. If it's a true service animal necessary to function that's one thing, but you can tell the difference. It's the completely untrained, uncontrolled animals that people have fudged the system to get on a plane....needs to stop.There should be a written notice that the person in the middle gets BOTH arm rests! If I have to be squished in-between overweight people (that should have to buy 2 tickets), I at least deserve the arm rests.Last, please be more forceful in telling people that are clearly bringing too many bags, that they need to check them. And put them under the plane.Bottom line, it's that SW has rules, but they don't enforce them. That would be my ask, enforce the rules, and kick those off that don't abide. Simple, hold people responsible.Thanks!"
"PRICES ARE subject to change at ALL TIMES, not at times.  If you cancel/change a flight, then you will pay much more, fine but I ended up paying more than what I clicked to buy.  It was not like this in the past. Watch click on purchase - WHAMO!  My change in point costs should have been a 5000 more, minutes after clicking purchase instead it cost 7000.  I should have canceled all together, but my sister would have been very disappointed.  And, when I changed the flight time, the points were attractive, on the phone they said the points were in addition to my original flight NOWHERE DOES IT SAY THAT!  The site said 2 left, I purchased at 5000 points in addition to my original ticket then jumped 7000 in points.  So, a total of 7000 points for each ticket overall.  In the past year I've experienced this, prior to any changes to a ticket, there were no additional costs.  Something they brag about.  Best to go with a cash credit card.  I'll be placing this warning on other review sites."
"I use to love southwest, but literally had to worst experience to and from my destination. Closed gate 15 minutes early leaving missed the flight partly (TSA’s unorganization.) Came back home Flight delayed an hour and half. Made it to DÍA and currently waiting longer than an hour for bags at baggage claim it’s almost 2:50 am no one wants to be waiting any longer than they did this is ridiculous."
"Bad experience in Denver, CO. I will pay more to fly another airline for my future flying needs.  No one will help you, lines are long, lines are slow and employees are rude.  I was turned away from counters and told to go to counters @ gates that were not occupied.  I was told at CS counters they weren't open, they needed to clean their station.  I was told I was put on standby and watched 4 others catch a flight I thought I was #1 on standby list.  I was given incorrect gate information, incorrect flight information.  SW employees saying we can get you to your destination the next day did not include the little details that it was a 2-stop flight and 6 hours long.  No one cares if you are stranded overnight or how long it takes to get you to your destination.  Which, by the way I never got to.  Was forced to find a closer destination and then find a 1-way car rental and drive the remaining 2 hours and then another 2 hours home.My experience was supposedly weather related on a bright and sunny summer day in early June."
I called to get assistance with booking a flight. Mary Brown with employee the number SC23 was amazing! I had called previously and spoke to an assistant who at no point offered me assistance. Keep up the good work Mary Brown.
flew Southwest from Chicago to Las Vegas on 6/2 and Vegas to Chicago on 6/6.  Both flights were delayed for over an hour.   the flight from Las vegas to chicago turned bumpy and we were all trying our best to return from bathroom to our seats.  One of the flight attendants was super unfriendly  and started screaming at the passengers over the intercom.  Very unprofessional behavior!  There were two flights attendants on board for the next flight and even they were shocked at this attitude from the flight attendant.  Don't hire people that are unhappy with this job.  I will try my best to avoid Southwest Airlines.. its gone down the drain in last 2 years.
Flew SWA to Cancun and back in May.  No issues on flight to Cancun.  Changed planes at HOBBY.  Both flights took off on time.  Return flight with 3 hour layover in Baltimore.  Boarded plane.  Sat for about an hour.  No one to load luggage.  Not the airlines fault.  Will fly SWA again!
"I just want to say that I’m very disappointed that people mainly get the help they need by being a loud pain in the butt. I’ve seen so many clients in vet med that scream and holler to end up getting what they want. But I politely plead for help to correct the birthdate on my boarding pass so TSA will let me through security and still catch my flight; and with zero compassion, I am told to wait in a very long, very slow moving line and then the person laughed when he said “you’re not going to be happy, the next flight isn’t until tomorrow”. It look me twice as long to wait in that line than it did to check in my bag at one of the 10+ kiosks, drop off my checked bag in one of the 4+ lines, scan my boarding pass (without anyone there so thankfully it worked) to get on a shuttle, and try to go through security in one of the 4+ checkpoints where I was told I have to go back and fix my birthdate. When I needed help from an actual human being, I was given none. I did not scream or cause a scene. I simply asked someone to please help me."
"Pretty bad experience, they will rebook your flight without asking you if it works with you or not. It is like they understand your schedule and priority. Even though other earlier flights has space they will not let you go on that flight. I couldn’t understand the logic. Really feel bad for the folks who are sitting at the desk and explaining to the passengers.No care for you, about your food if you are getting late there. You are just another customer for the airlines. I will recommend not to book this flight anymore. I used to be like them a lot as some of their policies like luggage and sitting are pretty good."
"Was enticed to enroll in rewards program with promise of $200 credit on my gift card - never got the $200 credit.  Flight out of Burbank left on time, but flight out of Dallas to Orlando was delayed over 12 hours.  In the past, such a delay resulted in free tickets for later use.  Didn't even get a free cocktail.  Seats are designed for a child, no leg room, and if you try to recline, you get about 2 inches."
"The absolute worst of the bunch.  I cannot even keep track of how many times I was screwed over by Southwest on this trip.  Booked a non-stop both directions flight was changed to connecting, paid for early bird check-in...never happened - somehow the computer dropped it they said - with zero help or resolution.  so we were last to board and you know they are messed up with their policy of not letting you choose a seat.  The dumbest thing I've ever seen so goodbye Southwest.  Never again."
"Well, Southwest, you used to be my second favorite airline... It looks like Jetblue has stolen your spot. Also, Delta airlines is my FAVORITE airline. It also looks like Southwest can't count... I'm not going to go into that long story but the flight was terrible... You kept trying to say to people that it was some problem with the passengers but actually that was a lame excuse. Never mind all the things that you said, you just look like you can't count because you ""Tried"" counting septillion times... But yeah, maybe you should go back to preschool... Lol... Anyway, people, I don't recommend Southwest, I recommend Delta or Jetblue. You've been warned."
I arranged Nashville to Las Vegas travel thru Southwest. It was a special occasion and purchased Business Select ticket and paid premium price. Only thing I got additional is to check in quick and one drink coupon for each traveler (it is $7.00/ per drink if you buy your own). This is total disappointment and  not worth to by Business Select.
Can't even book a flight if their call back system does not work as designed.  It called me back 3 x and hung up each time on me.  I am presently on hold for an 'estimated' 82 minutes to book a flight.  Now I do not even have the option of a [apparently broken] call back system. I guess their time is valuable though not mine.  After this fiasco I am also getting rid of both of my rapid rewards card as the points earned has been diminishing over the years to the point of 'what is the point of this'?  I guess stock/share holders again are the winners of this crappy airline.  It used to be worth it.  No clearly a waste of time.
Flight 1166 from Chicago to Omaha Nebraska. We sat on the runway for almost an hour (55 mins) for a bag! Flights have left with people who have missed their connection but you’re telling me we sat in the runway for a bag!
"I used to strictly travel SW and I travel 2-4 times a month.  They used to be a good airline and treat their customer fair, but this year I have gotten stranded twice because of technology issues and they try and blame it on weather so they do not have to compensate you!  Do not fly SW or you could be at risk getting stranded and having to pay all your expenses.  My last issue the weekend of 4/3/22 cost me an additional $1,200 to get home - buyer beware!  They gave me a $250 credit and tried to blame it on weather - what a joke!"
"I am writing you as an A-List member. I was originally booked on flight 308. Flight originally departed at 5:25pm, then was delayed to depart at 7pm, then my Houston flight was delayed to depart at 10:40pm, then 11:10pm, then 11:40pm, then my Cancun to Houston flight was canceled at 6:14pm. I was in the airport from 2pm - 7:30pm. I tried to call southwest, normally when i call the A-list line immediately picks up with my account info by my cell phone number. For some reason, this time (using the same cell phone number that’s on file) i had to type in my RR number. The system didn’t recognize my number, which is odd as this has never happened before. I selected the option without a RR number and the wait was 126 mins. Wow!The next day my flight to Houston was delayed. Original departure time was 1:05pm and delayed to leave at 2:22pm (flight 306). The check bag service was slow in the A-list line which caused me to not have time to check my bag and caused me to be rebooked on flight 1996 (Cancun to St. Louis). Now i am traveling 3hrs to STL and 2hrs to Dallas. Terrible service. This has been a stressful and long 2 days.I had to quickly figure out hotel plans in a foreign country in which all my family left the day before or earlier that day. Now I’m in a foreign country by myself when it was 70 people at my cousin’s wedding. I ultimately booked a hotel stay for $400. I spent another $300 on taxis and food for the night.I received a $250 voucher for a delayed flight this year (2022). I feel southwest should reimburse me for the cost of my original flight, hotel, food/taxis cost and voucher for the delays and cancellation.I do not expect to be treated like this as an A-List member. Hopefully southwest will rectify this situation an experience.Thanks,Deleandro WalkerRapid Rewards number = 20236113354"
"Worst experience. Flight delayed did more than 3 hours without cancellation and/or chance to reschedule. No documented bags returned. No apologies, super deficient customer service at the airport."
"while I was in the middle of entering information to order my flights,  I entered the complete tab and an error message appeared. it would not let me finish THE PROCESS. after searching out ""WHY"" it was because there was a price increase from the original quote.😢😒I AM A RAPID REWARD USER WITH OVER 200k POINTS."
"Flights were delayed for hours on end the finally cancelled at the end of the day. 6+ hours waiting for plane all to be told that the flight was cancelled due to weather even though Southwest released a press release apologizing for a tech issue that caused cancellations. On top of that we spent 4 hours waiting for our checked in baggage to be returned to us for the company to say they are just going to send it to final destination. We are STRANDED IN ANOTHER STATE with no return and no complimentary overnight stay. For the sake of your consumers, I hope you go out of business so no one has to experience what my family and thousands of other people have had to experience with your company."
Screwed up my flight change. Got charged more rather than a refund like I thought it would be. It was totally my fault and I really thought I was just out of luck. Since I ALWAYS get satisfaction with Southwest I gave it a try. The customer service rep had to go to her supervisor to figure out how to get me back to where I was and refund the additional charge.  Southwest rocks. I have bee flying them for years and  they never fail to totally satisfy me.
"No fault of SW airlines. To the person who was seated in row 1 on Southwest flight 161 Las Vegas to Denver arriving at 9:40 a.m. on March 16,  kindly respond using messenger via this facebook page at  identifying yourself.  There will be no lawsuit and so far medical costs are minimal. However, out of courtesy in case of more insurance needs know that the person located in row 2 that you slammed in the back of the head with your suitcase was in fact injured and no contact information was exchanged before you then exited.  The airline did file a report and did what they could under the circumstances.  Thank you."
"Their practice of charging to transfer Southwest (SW) rewards points from one member to another is unethical, deceitful, and easily misinterpreted! I got charged $600 to transfer 60,000 points to my daughter because she was making our reservations for 4 tickets because she had a SW credit she was using also. When she couldn't use her SW credit and the reward points she transferred them back to me and also got charged $600. We thought the charge was a ""holding fee"" and never dreamed that we were actually being charged $600. Is that even legal to be charged again for points I earned through prior purchases with my Chase SW credit card?I immediately called SW and spoke with a rep, who eventually transferred me to a specialist and both said they could do nothing. Mind you, it was an almost 2 hour call, mostly on hold! Now I have been charged $1,200 for NOTHING! This is the first, and last, time we will fly SW.In the spirit of transparency and good faith business practice, SW should not allow passengers to transfer points on-line but require them to call and speak with a SW agent. Then the agent can make sure the customer understands that they will be charged an astronomical amount to proceed with the transaction! If that was clear I would never have transferred the points and then have my daughter transfer them back to me. Obviously, we grossly misunderstood their policy on transferring points.In checking out SW reviews others have also complained of this very same thing. Not that their rating could get any worse as Better Business Bureau gave them a D rating and 1.15 out of 5 stars. Trust Pilot website rated them 1.8 stars out of 5. I'd leave a negative 1 star if I could. Obviously, they continue to practice in an unrighteous manner and the public needs to be alerted so they don’t fall victim of SW’s unethical, deceitful practice! This practice needs to be exposed and it needs to be changed!"
"Southwest Airlines has quickly gone to the top in worst airlines.  No customer service. Last minute cancellations, over booking, refusing refunds on flights that they cancel.  The airline industry as a whole has become horrible, but Southwest has taken the lead in making it worse!"
"Incredible delays from Phoenix to Denver so that SW could wait for two pilots to ferry to Denver for some other flight. Made a full plane, packed to the gills, over 100 people wait nearly an hour and a half in the plane on the ground. Then when we got to Denver, waited an eternity for our luggage. Worst performance by SW that I can ever remember."
"Worst experience I've ever had aboard a plane.  Southwest is an awful, bungling, disorganized, mismanaged organization that doesn't understand time management or how to meet customer needs.  Flight was 1/2 late due to de-icing.  Stopped again to accommodate panicky customer, then search cargo hold for another.  Customer service reps come aboard to inform all connecting flights, three hours after supposed take off, that they have no chance of reaching their connecting flights.  Chaos ensues as Southwest Reps attempt to service the horde of customers they've just inconvenienced.  Rather than give them another hour of my time, I left.  Won't be giving them another shot, don't recommend either."
"Costumer service is literally a jokeHave literally waited for an actual answer from them for almost 2 years, where I have messaged them on Facebook and emailed them numerous times without luck. It is ridiculous. I'm a broke student from Denmark, they still haven't assisted me and I still have no sign of my 800$...I'm frustrated and furious. How can a company be so busy for 2 freaking years, that they can't assist me with an easy fix problem, outrageousUpdate:Heard back from them stating they aren't gonna bother to respond to my issue anymore. Blowing this whole thing over, with no sign of my 800$, which I will definitely not get at this point. How can someone run a company like this, robbing their customers and when trying to complain silencing their voice. Mindbaffiling. Please for your own sake, DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!"
"I love that Southwest makes it easier for me to make decisions on which outfits to pack due to their flexible luggage fees. Also, being able to select your flight is a greatly appreciated. My Southwest experience has always been smooth arrival and departures."
This is the worst airlines in the sky and the most dishonest.  SW double billed me by having a third party lender that was on line.  They said they have no third party venders.  I can tell you I purchased two tickets from a third party and sent SW my credit card statement.  SW cant seem to find the time to cal or write me.  Guess their out of lies.
They went downhill the day they bought air Tran. I used to fly southwest 25-30times per year.  I will never fly with them again. They went from the best domestic airline to the bottom. Only delta and American are worse. But they are now in the same category. Just poopy. One day I will only drive in the USA. Like John madden did.
