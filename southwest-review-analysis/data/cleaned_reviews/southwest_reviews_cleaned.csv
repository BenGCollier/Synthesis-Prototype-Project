"Negative stars!  I had 4 flights for my family to get home extremely late.  I saw that they had a different one that worked to get us home earlier so I changed to that one for $575.  After getting to the airport, our new flight was delayed and now we will miss our connecting flight home.  They now have us on the original flight home because it's the only one and they won't refund me my 575 dollars that I paid when I changed my flight.  The lady at the kiosk was extremely rude, Joelene was her name.  She had no empathy and refused to take care of me after I called her on her rudeness.  She literally moved on to other customers and ignored me from there.  Delays happen, I get it but putting me back on my original flight home and keeping my 575 is a scam of all scams!!!  Don't use this garbage airline",negative stars flights family get home extremely late saw different one worked get us home earlier changed one getting airport new flight delayed miss connecting flight home us original flight home one wont refund dollars paid changed flight lady kiosk extremely rude joelene name empathy refused take care called rudeness literally moved customers ignored delays happen get putting back original flight home keeping scam scams dont use garbage airline

First and last time flying with this laires. They say that seat assignments are available 24 hours before the flight. Not a good experience.,first last time flying laires say seat assignments available hours flight good experience
Terrible.  Worst flight I’ve ever taken anywhere in the world.  Passenger next to me never put his seat belt on and the cabin crew did not ever check the cabin.  They were too taken up cracking childish jokes as though the whole flight was a joke to them.   Said passenger was also texting and receiving texts during landing.  Airline safety surely isn’t a joke?,terrible worst flight ive ever taken anywhere world passenger next never put seat belt cabin crew ever check cabin taken cracking childish jokes though whole flight joke said passenger also texting receiving texts landing airline safety surely isnt joke
My luggage was irreparably damaged by their baggage handlers whern I arrived at my destination.  I had a dent and a gauge or hole in my luggage. They said the dent was normal wear and tear but the hole was their liability. Do they gave me a voucher for $50 for a future flight. I took my luggage and the repair person said it was not repairable. I complained through Better Business Bureau and this time Southwest went back on their orginal statement and said this was normal wear and tear.  So I am out a lot of money for a new bag. Southwest does not really save you money for any money I saved on the flight will be spent on new luggage. I will never fly Southwest again. I had a similar incident a long time ago with Delta where they put an irreparable hole in my luggage and they paid me for a new bag. Delta maybe more expensive but they are at least honest.,luggage irreparably damaged baggage handlers whern arrived destination dent gauge hole luggage said dent normal wear tear hole liability gave voucher future flight took luggage repair person said repairable complained better business bureau time southwest went back orginal statement said normal wear tear lot money new bag southwest really save money money saved flight spent new luggage never fly southwest similar incident long time ago delta put irreparable hole luggage paid new bag delta maybe expensive least honest
"I have been a faithful customer of Southwest for years and have had mostly good experiences. I'm very disappointed, however, if the recent changes at Southwest - charging for baggage, reducing the length of time that flight credits can be used - I counted on these features. How I'll just start looking at Delta Airlines when I'm traveling.",faithful customer southwest years mostly good experiences im disappointed however recent changes southwest charging baggage reducing length time flight credits used counted features ill start looking delta airlines im traveling
"I had the worst experience flying with Southwest Airlines. My family of five travels together with one large luggage to keep things simple and convenient. However, on our return flight, they charged us an extra $200 because our luggage was exceeding the standard size by just 5 inches. This is absolutely ridiculous! We could have easily checked in 5 smaller bags, each included in the price, but that would have taken up more space in the compartment and added more weight — making this policy clearly about squeezing more money out of customers, not about space or weight. To make matters worse, we weren't charged this fee on the flight in, but only on the way out. They claimed they changed the policy during our vacation, which felt like a total scam. This is pure corporate greed! I will never fly with Southwest again. Avoid this airline at all costs — they are nothing but scammers and crooks!",worst experience flying southwest airlines family five travels together one large luggage keep things simple convenient however return flight charged us extra luggage exceeding standard size inches absolutely ridiculous could easily checked smaller bags included price would taken space compartment added weight making policy clearly squeezing money customers space weight make matters worse werent charged fee flight way claimed changed policy vacation felt like total scam pure corporate greed never fly southwest avoid airline costs nothing scammers crooks
"This review is strictly my opinion.  My review is based upon changes that the airline has made, will make, or probable changes in the future.  SWA continues to devalue Rapid Rewards (as it has done time and time again) and has upcoming plans to further devalue.  They will begin implementing much less fair dynamic points pricing.  This will make their rewards program much less advantageous compared to other airlines.  SWA will begin checked-bag fees.  They have always been ahead of the pack in the past with no bag fees.  This will be going away.   Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA will start assigning seats (which implies charging for seats).  They are becoming their competitors, which is insanely unnecessary. Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Not only is SWA devaluing their reward points, they may also add expirations to points.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  SWA may soon worsen flight credit expiration; which may naturally lead to charges for cancelled or changed flights.  Again, much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  Anticipated future changes are higher obstacles to acquire A-list, A-list preferred, and companion pass status; as well as reducing the perks and value.  SWA may even start charging for carry-on bags.  All of this makes them much less competitive and much less advantageous compared with other airlines.  I believe that they are repeatedly punching the guts of their long-time loyal customers.  None of their changes will inspire loyalty.  These changes will be quite advantageous to the other airlines as customers will be driven away into the waiting arms of the other carriers.  The leadership at SWA has landed themselves into positions that they don't belong in and have absolutely no business in.   It is obvious that SWA is trading long-term success and loyalty for short-term profits.  This is all both sad and maddening.  I hope that the majority share holders can smell the stink of all these changes and kick the current decision makers to the curb.  I wish you all luck with choosing other airlines.",review strictly opinion review based upon changes airline made make probable changes future swa continues devalue rapid rewards done time time upcoming plans devalue begin implementing much less fair dynamic points pricing make rewards program much less advantageous compared airlines swa begin checkedbag fees always ahead pack past bag fees going away much less advantageous compared airlines swa start assigning seats implies charging seats becoming competitors insanely unnecessary much less advantageous compared airlines swa devaluing reward points may also add expirations points much less advantageous compared airlines swa may soon worsen flight credit expiration may naturally lead charges cancelled changed flights much less advantageous compared airlines anticipated future changes higher obstacles acquire alist alist preferred companion pass status well reducing perks value swa may even start charging carryon bags makes much less competitive much less advantageous compared airlines believe repeatedly punching guts longtime loyal customers none changes inspire loyalty changes quite advantageous airlines customers driven away waiting arms carriers leadership swa landed positions dont belong absolutely business obvious swa trading longterm success loyalty shortterm profits sad maddening hope majority share holders smell stink changes kick current decision makers curb wish luck choosing airlines
I purchased EarlyBird Checkin for a total of $40 for one trip. I got B25. They claimed 70 people were ahead of me with priority of A-List and A-List Preferred. I don't believe this at all! This is a scummy airline. Now they're charging for bags when they used to brag about not charging and laugh at other airlines! I'll never fly them again and neither should you. They've gone downhill so fast!Every year since Robert Jordan was promoted to CEO in 2022 there has been a huge controversy. He is in WAY over his head and should be fired!!!

"Southwest Airlines has long prided itself on being different than other airlines: from free checked bags to open seating, many distinguishing factors led me as well as millions of other customers to choose Southwest. That era is sadly at an end. With the adoption of a “penny-wise, pound-foolish” approach, Southwest’s decision to end the aforementioned features will likely result in customers abandoning it for other airlines. I grew up using Southwest, as it is a “family-friendly” airline through the baggage and seating policy. Now, little is left policy-wise to distinguish it from any other airline and the “family-friendly” factor is lost. I highly doubt that I will hear the words “thank you for choosing Southwest” after a flight ever again after they have chosen to shift away from consumers and long-term reputation towards investors and short-term revenue prioritization.",southwest airlines long prided different airlines free checked bags open seating many distinguishing factors led well millions customers choose southwest era sadly end adoption pennywise poundfoolish approach southwests decision end aforementioned features likely result customers abandoning airlines grew using southwest familyfriendly airline baggage seating policy little left policywise distinguish airline familyfriendly factor lost highly doubt hear words thank choosing southwest flight ever chosen shift away consumers longterm reputation towards investors shortterm revenue prioritization
HORRIBLE! Paid premium rates for my whole family to be priority A boarding and they let a whole bunch of people FAKING needing wheelchairs on the plane and my family and I were forced to sit far in the back despite paying premium prices where all the lying lifestyle fat people got to sit in the front seats and they all spread out since the flight wasn’t full so 1 fatty sat in a middle and they refused to move. The early “disabled” boarding should be forced  to the back of the plane.  If someone pays double or triple fare to guarantee front seats they should get their seats!! You lost this frequent flyer forever.,horrible paid premium rates whole family priority boarding let whole bunch people faking needing wheelchairs plane family forced sit far back despite paying premium prices lying lifestyle fat people got sit front seats spread since flight wasnt full fatty sat middle refused move early disabled boarding forced back plane someone pays double triple fare guarantee front seats get seats lost frequent flyer forever

"Deeply Disappointed - Unprofessional and Unhelpful StaffI am a frequent Southwest flyer, and while I generally appreciate the airline, the Oakland location stands out for all the wrong reasons. The staff here have consistently been the rudest, least helpful airline employees I have encountered--not just within Southwest, but across any airline l've flown.It is abundantly clear that many of them do not want to be there, and unfortunately, they take that frustration out on the very people they are paid to assist-the customers. Their attitude is not just indifferent; it's actively hostile. Rather than providing solutions, they seem determined to find any possible reason to make the travel experience more difficult, whether that means creating unnecessary issues with baggage or simply refusing to be accommodating in even the smallest ways. I have been to this location multiple times and this has been my experience every time.This starkly contrasts with my experiences at Burbank Airport, where the Southwest crew is consistently welcoming, professional, and genuinely helpful. It's disappointing that such a dramatic difference exists within the same airline.Southwest as a company should seriously reevaluate the customer service culture at its Oakland location, because right now, it's doing a disservice to both the airline's reputation and its loyal passengers.",deeply disappointed unprofessional unhelpful staffi frequent southwest flyer generally appreciate airline oakland location stands wrong reasons staff consistently rudest least helpful airline employees encounterednot within southwest across airline lve flownit abundantly clear many want unfortunately take frustration people paid assistthe customers attitude indifferent actively hostile rather providing solutions seem determined find possible reason make travel experience difficult whether means creating unnecessary issues baggage simply refusing accommodating even smallest ways location multiple times experience every timethis starkly contrasts experiences burbank airport southwest crew consistently welcoming professional genuinely helpful disappointing dramatic difference exists within airlinesouthwest company seriously reevaluate customer service culture oakland location right disservice airlines reputation loyal passengers
I generally like Southwest.  However there’s some airline employees that simply are not intelligent.  First we are told that the upper storage is small.  I’ve brought the same bag a dozen times on various plane types but this is a MAX8.  It’s a newer plane and storage is more than ample and was designed that way!!!.  I know she’s wrong but I compact it even more.   She measures it and tells me I need to check it.  So while I know she’s a flaming idiot I comply because it is a commie process and they can decide if you fly or not.  I get on board after checking my bag.  Over the intercom they say that the bins are large.  Ok.  Which is it Southwest?  Shouldn’t the attendants know what the hell they are saying and doing?   Now I have a checked bag because we an have an idiot at the gate who is using an old baggage sizing for an old plane.  Some people just never figured out how to fit the square block in the square hole and are now controlling people that passed that test with flying colors!!!!  Please do something about these people because I’m slowly moving towards delta.   It’s way more convenient but not a direct flight…. It seems it may be worth it though especially when you go to assigned seating… I’m sitting here hating Southwest right now because I have to abide by rude controlling people that are less intelligent then me.,generally like southwest however theres airline employees simply intelligent first told upper storage small ive brought bag dozen times various plane types max newer plane storage ample designed way know shes wrong compact even measures tells need check know shes flaming idiot comply commie process decide fly get board checking bag intercom say bins large ok southwest shouldnt attendants know hell saying checked bag idiot gate using old baggage sizing old plane people never figured fit square block square hole controlling people passed test flying colors please something people im slowly moving towards delta way convenient direct flight seems may worth though especially go assigned seating im sitting hating southwest right abide rude controlling people less intelligent

"I am usually reluctant to write reviews because consumer facing business is difficult. But Southwest Airlines is a miserable experience top to bottom, especially with all forms of phone support. Customer care treated me with extreme rudeness and then outright hostility when I was unable to change my password that appeared in a data breach of their services. Ultimately, after being yelled at I was hung up on. I called back and not one but two customer care reps were unable to find a record of the call or the email I was sent from their system. The website is a relic with subpar performance and security. No one seems to care. I can only assume this level of mediocrity extends to all services including the safety of air travel. Years ago, SW was a great company, but they are stuck in the past and it's reflected across the board. I can't say I'll never travel SW especially for short hops, but they will be the absolute last resort.",usually reluctant write reviews consumer facing business difficult southwest airlines miserable experience top bottom especially forms phone support customer care treated extreme rudeness outright hostility unable change password appeared data breach services ultimately yelled hung called back one two customer care reps unable find record call email sent system website relic subpar performance security one seems care assume level mediocrity extends services including safety air travel years ago sw great company stuck past reflected across board cant say ill never travel sw especially short hops absolute last resort
"First off I have over 100 thousand miles in the air with Delta in South African air so I should have book my flight with Delta but we went through a travel agent instead of doing it myself first mistake second mistake is accepting Southwest. The people are amazing No complaints there, but the company bought brand new planes and put an extra seat in them so now no room for a cart to go between the Aisle.

"It is ridiculous that Southwest allows a family of four to earn points together when they fly, but then they can’t book together when using the points and requires each family member including kids to book their own flight separately.  Seems like Southwest really needs to improve their policies and let a family with kids combine their points to book together on one account! Seems silly to make four family members all login separately to try to get flights. The points are becoming worthless.  Then, the kids each have separate flights not connected to the parents app and it becomes a problem.

"I recently experienced what I consider to be terrible customer service from every level of customer service from checkin to boarding of the aircraft. I was flying from Las Vegas to Boise and it was a Saturday early evening. I tried to checkin at the counter downstairs where the lady waved me over and then said, Go check in at the self checkin. I had questions, but she wouldn't help, she said, you dont have bags so go checkin at self checkout.  I was taken back by her rudeness, and there was nobody ahead of me or behind me. Then, I get upstairs and am trying to get through to my gate, and the information on my boarding pass didnt match my gate information. The individuals at gates C11 C12 & C14 would not help, to busy talking amongst themselves to help. Once again, terrible customer service. Then prior to boarding, the Southwest Airline attendant allowed families with dogs to go first, not disabled, veterans or people needing extra time. This is crazy! I had pre boarding but, I could barely get to the counter because his lack of controlling people around his desk area. When trying to scan my boarding pass, it was not working, so the attendant grabbed my phone and slammed it on the scanner.

"When attempting to update my trip (Wanna Get Away Plus) from Sunday flight to a Saturday flight, I was able to select 2 seats for $523 using the app. However, the app does not allow you to update a reservation when you have a lap child (a very ridiculous restriction).I immediately called southwest, and they informed me the tickets were now $840. I expressed how I could see the tickets on the app (even after refreshing) and after 20 mins, was able to get the agent to split my reservation so my wife's ticket was $523 and my ticket was $840. They were unable to honor the price I should have received if the app had just worked.

"On 9/30/24 I was buying a ticket for my mom to come with me on a trip. After I purchased the ticket, I realized I had inadvertantly gotten a duplicate ticket for myself. My mistake, I really don't know how I missed putting in her details. I cancelled that ticket and was immediately going to buy her ticket , so I just did a flight credit. I put in her information and everything was going well until I tried to pay. I could not use the flight credit to pay for her ticket because the flight credit was in my name!! I saw that the credit was transferable, so we made her an account, transferred the credit and bought her ticket. On Oct 2nd we cancelled the ticket. As it was past the 24 hours for free cancelation and a refund she got a flight credit to transfer back to me since I paid for the ticket. She was unable to do this because you can only transfer one time. As a new user with Southwest I was unaware that when you get a flight credit you can only use it for a flight in your name. I thought that I would have a credit to use however I needed as it is my money. Then when we cancelled the flight and she was issued a credit I fully expected that I could have it transferred back to me. I'm sure that there are others who hadn't read the one time rule either. So, I find that Southwest doesn't care if they cheat you out of your own money!! First by issuing you flight credit that you can't use as you wish. It's my money, I should be able to purchase a ticket for anyone I want. Second by only allowing a one time credit transfer. I realize that it was my mistake in the first place not putting the ticket in her name, but it was a mistake. Southwest had the opportunity to rectify this when I called and when I filed a complaint. I didn't ask for a refund, I simply wanted the flight credit back in my name. So for an honest mistake, I have lost over $711. Had I purchased the first ticket in her name, when she cancelled and got a flight credit, she would've been able to transfer it to me no issues, as that would've been the one and only transfer. For those who would say have my mom give me $711 and she has a flight credit to use. She cannot afford that, which is why I was buying her ticket in the first place.

"We made sure that we are on the correct gate according to the screens. Turns out that the screens were incorrect and the speakers didn’t work. A Southwest Airlines lady claimed that she told the group waiting here to switch gates. We were sitting there the whole time (for 1,5 h) and the information didn’t reach us. They weren’t also calling our names before closing the gate.Getting a refund was also tricky because they claimed it was our fault. Luckily I took a picture of the incorrect screen during departure time.I got vouchers and was forced to use southwest airlines once more. The vouchers didn’t cover the tax, so I had to pay 50$ none the less. I selected business class and oh boy it didn’t made a huge difference.. I had access to slow internet during he flight and I got a free drink voucher. I asked for a hot chocolate but it turns out that the drink had to be alcoholic (stupid, what if I’m pregnant?). So I ordered a beer and wanted to take it home. Before I was leaving a stewardess took the unopened can from me.. saying she has to, sooorry.

Even as I write this review, there still has not been an official reason given for the delay. We have been told as passengers that we will “get to our destination, as soon as we can“. I find this insufficient. With corporate executives making millions of dollars just last year and flying around on their own private planes, they are not (and will never be) subjected to the shocking levels of inconvenience and stress caused by aircraft delays. Many that are stuck here with me are missing important family events, or connecting flights. The contempt shown for passengers who paid them good money (and who are responsible for their rise to a nationally recognized airline) is amazing.

I have never encountered this kind of customer service on any airline before in my life.Barry is the name of the flight attendant that yelled at my 3 yr old daughter. She was sitting at the window seat. I was sitting in the aisle seat and my wife was in between us.I woke up to Barry leaning over me with his head right in front of my face yelling forcefully and directly to my 3 yr old daughter. My wife was in shock and froze.My daughter had put some decorative children’s tape on the window and seat in front of her. It peels off very easily. It’s one of several plane activities my wife had prepared for our young daughter. We removed the tape immediately.I don’t mind Barry asking me to remove the children’s tape or for my daughter not to put children’s decorative tape on the window and seat but his tone was intimidating and scary. His aggression toward my 3 yr old daughter was uncalled for, rude, and embarrassing. He is a loose canyon.I could hear others around me talking about how he acted and I decided to try and say something to him.Next time he came around, I politely tried to suggest to him that he did not need to use that tone with my 3 yr old daughter. He immediately snapped cutting me off and said something like, “if you don’t like it, write a letter to Southwest”. I couldn’t believe it.I had tried to ask him nicely and he was doubling down. He continued, “this is not your property, if you think it is ok to deface someone else’s property, then write a letter to Southwest”.I was calm and was trying to talk to him discreetly, but he was loud and made a scene.I said, “I didn’t say anything about WHAT you said, I’m talking about ‘how’ you said it”.

"The no assign seating practice is highly inappropriate. This is a country of selfish people who like their space. It makes no sense. Today takes the cake though. There were 2 empty seats back by the bathroom and they didn’t allow anyone to sit there on a very full plane. As someone traveling with their spouse and who uses the bathroom a lot; it sucks. You can screen share or be with them. If the plane crashes you’re all alone even if you didn’t travel alone. Why even assign seats in the ticket if it’s total bs.

The flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix was beautiful and have no complaints there. But at Sky Harbor airport at Baggage Claim my suitcase is purple and it's a plastic one with a pink name tag. Also the zipper that you can open to expand doesn't zip all the way. So I saw my suitcase and grabbed it bc of those identifiers. About 20 minutes later southwest representative calls me and said I had the wrong suitcase and of course I was so embarrassed and my step dad takes me back to the airport we were 20 minutes away. I get there and was apologizing a lot. The one Southwest employee a black woman went off on me and I was blown away. It was uncalled for and she was about to be recorded. So then I explained to the male employee what through me off and he agreed when be looked at the suitcases side by side that zipper was like mine and the pink tag like mineYes I should have looked at my name and I learned a lesson from it. And the person who the suitcase belong to was so ignorant I understood she was upset I would be also. However when I'm apologizing and I legit felt bad the least she could have done was acknowledge that. And your employee yelling at me in front of people was the most disgusting way to treat people in that line of work. I'm 52 yrs old and worked in customer service my adult life and I have never treated anyone like that. I could give her a pass if i was ignorant to her.

"Southwest Hotels provided the worst, most botched up hotel reservation experience of my life, and I'm a 63-yr-old frequent traveler, so that takes some doing!In mid-March booked a hotel stay  for 5 nights in June in Orange County. Received confirmation of the booking by Southwest, who was usin Agoda search engine. All seemed fine; Southwest even emailed me about the upcoming stay more than once to make sure I was organized. Then, we arrive on the day, and there is no booking in the hotel's system. An hour on the phone in the hotel lobby (mostly on hold) with Southwest Concierge, and finally they tell me they had a problem getting the payment that was successfully charged to my credit card in March to the hotel.No attempt to contact me. No attempt to fix it and find me another hotel. No offer of points for my trouble or.to compensate me in any way for the stress and inconvenience they caused me and my partner. Just s lame apology from the poor sap at the call center and an ""offer"" to refund me the money charged to my credit card in March in 7-10 business days.Southwest needs to GET OUT of the business of hotel booking, as a look in google shows their performance is horrendously bad.

Lack of extra fees for flight changes and baggage. Friendly staff.A couple of caveats: They never seem to have direct flights to anywhere I want to go. The Internet is often down. Business select doesn't offer much if you don't want a free drink. Early boarding (low A's) doesn't mean as much if there are so many preboarders.,almost always great experience southwest airlines great rewards program good flight experiences except weather delays affect airlines lack extra fees flight changes baggage friendly staffa couple caveats never seem direct flights anywhere want go internet often business select doesnt offer much dont want free drink early boarding low doesnt mean much many preboarders

"We have been flying Southwest Air for many years.  Well, yesterday on Flight 1571 from LAX to BWI, we experienced the worse flight of our life.  There was an older Flight Attendant that was not allowing people to get to the bathroom, she tossed snacks at you, and yelled loudly at an elderly gentleman.  The Lead Flight Attendant told us that WiFi would not be available on our flight.  For almost five (5) hours, we listened at crying, loud babies and kids.  My Husband called today to complain about the problems and was pretty much blown off by another older sounding woman at their Corporate Office.

"On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request.The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience.I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies.I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience. I will be choosing American Airlines for future travel.",encountered unexpected issue attempting check southwest flight airport despite booked flight month advance family funeral trip scheduled informed southwest agent needed consent form sisters travel minor niece nephew requirement unfamiliar previously traveled minors southwest airlines without encountering requestthe interaction agent supervisor disheartening exhibited rudeness disrespect towards despite explanations requests show willingness review travel history minors consider circumstances familys bereavement additionally given conflicting information acceptance notarized letter minors guardian causing confusion inconveniencei respectfully request review incident caused distress already challenging time hope feedback contribute improvements customer service clarity travel requirements passengers particularly sensitive situations family emergenciesi difficult experience southwest airlines unable board flight encountered unhelpful customer service despite received refund booked american airlines positive experience choosing american airlines future travel
"TSA randomly selects people for a secondary screening at the gate, which is out of all airlines control. However, with most airlines assigned seating, this only affects the flight you are selected for the screening for and doesn’t affect your boarding. With Southwest’s check in and reservation system, getting selected for secondary screening means you are in for major issues. Southwest’s well rehearsed response by phone support, check in personnel and gate agents, for the multiple impacts, is that it is not our fault’. That you were selected by the TSA, not Southwest, so you get nothing from Southwest to help rectify the situation of getting a late C group number when you went to all the trouble to check in and your spouse on the same reservation gets A group.It is true that it is TSA for being selected for the extra secondary security screening for the first flight. However, all the issues on subsequent connecting fights are caused by Southwest's reservation system and boarding process. There is no reason not to get assigned your legitimate place in line on the rest of your connecting flights as the TSA screening has nothing to do with them. Even worse then not being able to board with the rest of your party on the reservation on subsequent flights, is losing your TSA Pre Check from paying for Global Entry on the rest of your connecting flights. On international flights you usually need to go through security again after clearing customs. On my recent trip back from Mexico, the rest of my party with TSA Pre Check cleared security in 5 minutes and then waited another 50 minutes for me to finally show up. This is very much Southwest's issue. Other airlines with different reservation systems have none of these issues.There are things that Southwest could have and should have done on my connecting flight. I clearly should have had an A group number as all other folks on the reservation with me did. All the numbers are gone since the Southwest system would not assign my connecting flight boarding position since it wouldn’t assign the 1st flight. However, Southwest lets ""special circumstance"" folks board after the A group, before the B group. When I asked the gate agent in Miami, Monica V., if there was anything I could do to board at least close to the rest of my party, she parroted the party line that is was TSA’s fault and that there was nothing she could do. When I mentioned boarding after the A’s, she got that hostile look like I was just another low life trouble maker trying to cheat my way onto the plane before my turn. She stated that was ONLY for disabled passengers and my issue was not a Southwest problem.An even better solution is for Southwest to still issue you your boarding position number for your connecting flights and not remove TSA PRE from your connecting flight boarding pass",tsa randomly selects people secondary screening gate airlines control however airlines assigned seating affects flight selected screening doesnt affect boarding southwests check reservation system getting selected secondary screening means major issues southwests well rehearsed response phone support check personnel gate agents multiple impacts fault selected tsa southwest get nothing southwest help rectify situation getting late c group number went trouble check spouse reservation gets groupit true tsa selected extra secondary security screening first flight however issues subsequent connecting fights caused southwests reservation system boarding process reason get assigned legitimate place line rest connecting flights tsa screening nothing even worse able board rest party reservation subsequent flights losing tsa pre check paying global entry rest connecting flights international flights usually need go security clearing customs recent trip back mexico rest party tsa pre check cleared security minutes waited another minutes finally show much southwests issue airlines different reservation systems none issuesthere things southwest could done connecting flight clearly group number folks reservation numbers gone since southwest system would assign connecting flight boarding position since wouldnt assign st flight however southwest lets special circumstance folks board group b group asked gate agent miami monica v anything could board least close rest party parroted party line tsas fault nothing could mentioned boarding got hostile look like another low life trouble maker trying cheat way onto plane turn stated disabled passengers issue southwest probleman even better solution southwest still issue boarding position number connecting flights remove tsa pre connecting flight boarding pass

"Onboard SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight from Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale, just as the door closed to leave, I was assaulted by the Flight Attendant. As I was saying goodbye to my husband on my phone, a male flight attendant leaned past two passengers to jab his fingers into my shoulder. I was sitting in the window seat and suddenly felt pain in my shoulder from this male flight attendant's assault. I recently had rotator cuff surgery, and I was shocked that a man just poked me there. I am a 63 year old woman, and I pre-boarded due to disabilities. When I looked at him he said ""turn off your cell phone now"". The preparation announcements were just being made when this assault took place. As I said, I was telling my husband goodbye . With doors flying off, DEI hiring of pilots, and all the horrors of flying, I ALWAYS tell my husband I love him just before I take off. I did nothing wrong, and certainly, NO FLIGHT ATTENDANT HAS THE RIGHT TO JAB HIS HAND INTO ANYONE'S SHOULDER. Well, I contacted Southwest Airlines and they essentially called me a liar. (It took a month for a response from SWA) I provided them with full details and also a photograph of this flight attendant. Their delayed response was that the feedback of the crew member was that he did not recall. They quoted their policy: ""Once the entry doors are closed in preparation for pushback, cellular voice and data functions must be turned off"". So instead of being appalled and sorry for this assault, they implied somehow I did not know about turning off cell phones. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, yet NO ONE SHOULD BE physically assaulted by a flight attendant. SWA doesn't have the right to lay hands on a passenger. My complaint was completely blown off, and swept under the rug by SWA. They ended the correspondence by ""We hope you  will fly Southwest Airlines again and that your support and confidence is very important to us"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Why would I fly them again after they physically assaulted me? So after they assaulted a 63 year old woman with disabilities they took no responsibility, They we're very clear that somehow it was my fault that I was assaulted. Well, I am done flying SWA.

Booked Roundtrip flights for September 2023. We had also purchased the early bird for both legs of the trip. When it came time 36hrs before flight to check in for seat assignments we received a notice that we could nt get seat assignments until 24 hrs and that Southwest would let us know are boarding numbers. Then we received and email that said they could upgrade us to A boarding if we paid another $50 a piece.... which added up to an additional $100 dollars each for both legs of flight. That was $200 extra for both of us.....on top of the $100 dollars we already paid for the earlier Early bird fee when we booked the flight. We booked our flights four months prior to departure. I tried to find out what was going on but no one would answer my questions. There were several passengers with the same issue. Southwest had decided to change the way they do the early bird and the increased fee without any prior notification. Tried to get answers to what was going on from boarding person but she told me to contact the airlines directly. had to email because no one answered the phones and I was told sorry but there was nothing they could do since the fee's had changed literally like a day or two before our flight. I tried to get them to refund the early bird fee's that we had already paid earlier since we did not get early bird seating after all and could not pay an additional $200 at that point. Basically I was told there was nothing they could do. I have flown Southwest for many years but this last experience was enough to make me look elsewhere. To ask us to pay an additional $200 each for the flight.... was totally unreasonable.

"We were involuntarily bumped from our flight.

"This company went downhill.  First of all, the ticket counter made us get rid of stuff to board the plane.  We left our personal things at the ticket counter worth over an estimated $400 dollars because we were a few pounds over company policy.  After fumbling around the ticket counter for an hour, we almost miss our flight.  My family (wife, infant, toddler) had to run to the departure booth.  The manager at Myrtle Beach airport for southwest was extremely rude and mean.  She deserves to be be fired!  We were about to board the plane and she made us take things out of our bags (again!) and move things around saying we had too much stuff.  We had just been hassled at the ticket booth and dropped our stuff on the curb.  The manager and her ticket collector tried to charge us for the baby carrier. The manager and her staff at Myrtle Beach international airport were burned out, disrespectful and  mean.

"Southwest Airlines - poorly trained reservation personnel, no communication when they created an issue, no customer service to resolve a problem they created.We are sitting in the airport in San Jose, Costa Rica.  Had booked our roundtrip flights in November.  Art booked by calling Southwest directly as we were returning to the U.S. with our cat as carryon.  I had checked the Southwest website, and Art told the agent when he was making the reservations that our cat was coming back with us.

"POOPED ON!!!! Literally! SOUTHWEST Flight number #3332 from Las Vegas to Maui on August 31, 2023.  By a fellow passenger and Southwest refuses to pay for our damaged personal items.  I am reaching out through social media and the Internet to let people know about the situation. After many phone calls to Southwest corporate offices, they are still refusing to pay for the items that we’ve had to throw away. It all started when at the very beginning of our flight, we noticed a very bad smell coming from the woman in front of us. We thought that she was just having bad gas, but it smelled so bad the entire flight! When it was time to start getting ready to land, I reached under to get my belongings under her seat, and when I pulled them out and onto my lap, noticed that there was poop all over my things which by then had also got onto my arms and legs! I immediately got up and went to the front of the plane to speak with a steward and stewardess. They were shocked at what had happened and were so nice. In fact, the steward got into his own personal duffel bag, and gave me clothes to change into. I had to change in the front of the plane behind the steward, stewardess and my husband. Then quickly sit back down in another seat before we landed. After landing, we had to wait around for a very long time. We had to stand around the gate to talk to airport police and EMT. After a very long time EMT took her off the plane. She was completely soiled in her own feces, it was very sad. She had obviously just been released from the hospital because she had some kind of port in her hand and    bandages. She had not gotten up once the entire flight, and had continued to soil her self through the whole flight, and we had to sit behind and smell it the whole flight, and then deal with it getting on myself and our things. We were told by a SOUTHWEST employee that they had to unbolt and throw away the seats in that row she was sitting in! I have reached out many times to Southwest trying to get them to replace the items that I had to throw away. However, over and over they refused to be responsible for my damaged items. I tried to reason that since they threw their seats away and replaced them, then they should do the same for my things, but they refused. We have also had to get hepatitis testing due to the fact that her feces got onto my skin and I would like them to pay for that testing as well. Southwest says that they are not responsible for our damaged items. However, they are responsible for the actions of their passengers! Since Southwest will not contact me further regarding the situation, I feel the only thing left to do is to reach out to the Internet and social media, and let everyone know of this terrible situation.

This is the worst Airline I’ve ever flown with. Southwest Airlines should be ashamed of themselves for how bad they are doing business. First of all we paid for our flight tickets and selected certain seats in certain areas. Now as usual before boarding the plane you have to wait until the attendant announces the zone area that you will be seated in. So if all that is the normal procedure then why on earth do I have to play musical chairs when I get on the plane. If I paid for a window seat than I expect a window seat not a middle seat for 4 hours. That is a sad surprise for a customer and I couldn’t even sit together with my wife. I purchased two seats that was together so what changed when we got on the plane? That was awful and terrible and no one had any clear answers for me. I will never fly with this airline again. And I will make it my mission to tell as many people as I possibly can to avoid you as well.,worst airline ive ever flown southwest airlines ashamed bad business first paid flight tickets selected certain seats certain areas usual boarding plane wait attendant announces zone area seated normal procedure earth play musical chairs get plane paid window seat expect window seat middle seat hours sad surprise customer couldnt even sit together wife purchased two seats together changed got plane awful terrible one clear answers never fly airline make mission tell many people possibly avoid well

"SW did not honor expired voucher they told me they would. Left stranded at BDL Windsor Locks Hartford Connecticut airport late evening with my 2 children. No customer service or employees at gate or ticket counter. They canceled flight due to engine trouble, an hour wait on board with poor air circulation. One single SW staff member was available to print vouchers for those who waited in line. Delaying us another hour and a 1/2 expecting a refund. However, a credit voucher was all they were willing to accommodate. Thankfully, American  Airlines got us home safely for a third less of the cost than Southwest charged me for the 14 day advanced purchase tickets aquited weeks prior to our flight.  When I receive my vouchers I recognize the ""expires 1 year from now statement"" on the ticket and brought that to the attention of the rep who printed it and handed it to me.  She stated (to the effect)  ""Just ignore that they don't go by that, they'll honor it""  My vouchers remained on my refrigerator behind a magnet for a long time past a year and I went to use them specifically for the emergency trip I would need to visit my mother who is in stage 4 Cancer and my family has informed me that I need to come now, last minute. Knowing from previous experience that the cost of airfare is ridiculously absurd if not purchased within the 14 advanced day period/window that my flight would be expensive. I saved the vouchers to use for this occasion as indicated previously and they denied them saying they have expired. Wiith health concerns of my own and work on hold, I haven't been able to come up with the funds currently/last minute to pay for my flight home to see my dying mother. I've flown with Southwest Airlines since the early 70s when they operated out of Dallas Texas in there startup years. SW was my favorite/number one airline of choice, up until this point. I called customer relations four times, I left emails to corporate as instructed to and never received a response. It's been four weeks. I called again yesterday spoke with two independent reps neither would honor my voucher and book detremental flight. Bear in mine this!  These provided vouchers were obtained during the onset of our Global pandemic, Coronavirus. I and the majority of Earthings refused to fly on a plane with uncertain contagious concerns of spreading the virus. If your one of those who believe its completely safe ans cannot catch the Coronavirus or any other illness aboard an enclosed, continuous air circulation cabin area and believe that, I pity you! Nobody at that time was flying in the air on aircraft. I certainly wasn't going to spend my vouchers on a planned flight. I saved them for emergency purposes only, such as this one and solely for this purpose. It's for the sake of using them because they canceled their flight and gave me vouchers instead of my money back leaving us stranded in Connecticut with no service. I have reached out to an attorney that I'm suing in general sessions court for $25000 The maximum allotted in General Sessions.  Here's one of my confirmation numbers for any of you who work for Southwest and would like to investigate further, pre-prepare for our case. SW Legal department doesnt reply or answer calls either.

"Can I give zero stars?  Southwest (now Southworst) rebooked us midflight (while we were in the air) because they ""expected"" we would miss our connection from Las Vegas to San Diego.  But guess what?!?  We made it to the gate (C21) as they were announcing ""last boarding call"" and the gate agent was STILL boarding passengers and the plane doors not yet closed.  Then, gate agent ""Erika"" (who wears an ""aloha"" button but does not live aloha), refused to reissue boarding passes for myself, my wife and daughter plus another five or so passengers to whom SWA did the same thing. Erika tried saying there was a ""weight"" issue (but we know that's a lie!) and then said the ""higher ups"" said she could not give us boarding passes (passing the buck? Or a telling slip of the tongue?🤔).  Then after waiting at the counter Erika told us ""the doors are closed."" They certainly were at that point because she stalled us on purpose.Erika then called over Supervisor Polet N who also refused to provide ANY explanation why we were all denied boarding.  When we (I, ok, yes I am a lawyer) pressed Polet N about rebooking us on another flight (on any airline as required by federal law - which Polet agreed she was required to do) she put on her fake and superficial ""SWA smile"" and said simply, ""we are not going to do that.""  Polet did not even try.  No LUV there!!!Adding insult to injury SWA issued us a hotel voucher for the OYO Hotel (formerly the Hooters Hotel) which is a scuzzy, fleabag hotel that charges $40/ night and has $1 blackjack all day (that alone tells you everything you need to know about who SWA partners with!)The only thing I can think of that makes any sense is that SWA rebooked us midflight because they (yes, there are actual people who make these decisions) did not want to have to reimburse us for the cost our tickets if we missed the connection because of THEIR ramp delay and they cared more about an ""on time"" departure from Vegas (which they can claim when the plane doors are closed and they push back from the gate) than they did stranding a half dozen passengers in Vegas on a Sunday night.Oh, we did get $200 SWA LUV vouchers that we have to use within one year and only on another SWA flight - they really think I want to fly SWA again?!?  But a voucher is better for the bottomline than paying for missed flights caused by the airline's delay.In short, SWA screwed us and then did nothing to assist in correcting THEIR mistake.  Instead they stranded us with no explanation.",give zero stars southwest southworst rebooked us midflight air expected would miss connection las vegas san diego guess made gate c announcing last boarding call gate agent still boarding passengers plane doors yet closed gate agent erika wears aloha button live aloha refused reissue boarding passes wife daughter plus another five passengers swa thing erika tried saying weight issue know thats lie said higher ups said could give us boarding passes passing buck telling slip tongue waiting counter erika told us doors closed certainly point stalled us purposeerika called supervisor polet n also refused provide explanation denied boarding ok yes lawyer pressed polet n rebooking us another flight airline required federal law polet agreed required put fake superficial swa smile said simply going polet even try luv thereadding insult injury swa issued us hotel voucher oyo hotel formerly hooters hotel scuzzy fleabag hotel charges night blackjack day alone tells everything need know swa partners withthe thing think makes sense swa rebooked us midflight yes actual people make decisions want reimburse us cost tickets missed connection ramp delay cared time departure vegas claim plane doors closed push back gate stranding half dozen passengers vegas sunday nightoh get swa luv vouchers use within one year another swa flight really think want fly swa voucher better bottomline paying missed flights caused airlines delayin short swa screwed us nothing assist correcting mistake instead stranded us explanation

"Our recent trip to and from BWI with layovers at MDW was delay-free.  And even though a previous return flight from PDX was cancelled due to a major storm system back East, Customer Service gave us three options to return the next day.  Airlines cannot control the weather, especially huge storm systems which can and do disrupt their operations nationwide.But they can control the remaining causes, including extended I.T. ""melt-downs,"" mechanical issues, and crew scheduling.Due to the widespread impact of the Covid epidemic, Southwest clearly failed to accurately predict the increase in demand for new pilots and the timing to retrain sufficient pilots returning from lay-off.  The result   continues to be a lack of adequate staffing, resulting in additional cancellations.And as for the several major I.T. ""melt-downs,"" I am sure that Southwest would admit there is no excuse.But despite all of this, basis my past and present experience with each and every Southwest employee, there is absolutely no comparison between Southwest and any other domestic airline, period.",recent trip bwi layovers mdw delayfree even though previous return flight pdx cancelled due major storm system back east customer service gave us three options return next day airlines cannot control weather especially huge storm systems disrupt operations nationwidebut control remaining causes including extended meltdowns mechanical issues crew schedulingdue widespread impact covid epidemic southwest clearly failed accurately predict increase demand new pilots timing retrain sufficient pilots returning layoff result continues lack adequate staffing resulting additional cancellationsand several major meltdowns sure southwest would admit excusebut despite basis past present experience every southwest employee absolutely comparison southwest domestic airline period

"URGENT COMPLAINT - confirmation number 27CYS7 - RR# 20713247251I am extremely disappointed that we drove to the Tampa International airport on 6/25/2023, waited for an hour to be told that our flight had been cancelled to DCA. The original customer service rep made an announcement and lied that the flight that we were moved to was a direct flight to DCA. It was not direct it was a layover overnight in Chicago. It was on my app where I was able to determine that she falt out lied over the intercom and to my husband, the flight was not direct, it was a layover in  Chicago that was 2 days later,  leaving Tampa International Airport on 6/27/2023. That change would caused us to be  overnight for two more days in Tampa, and then I was told there were no hotel accommodations that Southwest could provide.  We even asked Norma if we could contact Corporate and she said there was nothing that any of them could do about it. We have two small children, one that has Asthma and we would have had to stay in the airport overnight for 2 days since we they were not going to give us hotel accommodations for the inconvenience. After requesting that we be put on a flight that left on 6/25 as we originally planned, Norma  put us on a flight to Baltimore and that is an hour and a half away from our home. Then we had to have our 75 year old father come an hour away at a later time, to pick us up. We get to Baltimore and had to wait for a gate to be opened, and waited for over 30 minutes before even being able to get off the plane. We only fly Southwest, this is very disappointing. We should have been given a hotel stay, and we should have been told earlier about the flight cancellation. We landed around 10:10pm left BWI  3 hours of looking for our luggage. I even called the 1800 number for customer service to see if they could help and was told that all they could tell me was that our bags were there. I asked if I could file a claim and was told that I had to work with the customer service there at the Southwest desk.  The representatives  for SouthWest at BWI were rude, there was only one person that was helpful and that was LaKeisha Anderson. She was the only person that wasn’t rude and the only person who helped and showed true customers service. The other customer service reps either didn't have their badges on or had badges without names.  I would like to be reimbursed for all 4 of my return tickets and for this inconvenience. I can not believe this!Martha from Southwest customer service called me on 6/26 and was only able to offer a $250 credit per person for all 4 of us traveling, and thought that was enough compensation for Southwest gate assistance lying about the fly change,the automated system putting us on a flight that would leave 2 days later and was through Chicago to get to DCA, and then not offering us a hotel and transportation for those two day. Norma the flight attendant at the gate for Southwest telling us that Southwest doesn’t do hotel vouchers and she didn’t know were we would stay. To Norma transferring us to fly to Baltimore and then us dealing with rude and disrespectful Southwest employees, taking off badges so we couldn’t report them, then spending 3 hours in the airport looking for luggage. We landed at 10:15 and didn’t get any of our luggage until 1:19am. Shae worked to find two of them. At 1:27 LaKeisha ended up funding and bringing us our last luggage and was the only one helpful out the the entire staff. Shae helped looked for luggage but threatened customers. And all Southwest can offer for this experience is $250 per person. We should have a full refund at a min! Each one of those employees at BWI for Southwest that worked last night needs be terminated how they acted, except for LaKeisha. It’s ridiculous that she was the only respectful one. This needs to be escalated and we deserve more than the $250 per person that you all are trying to offer! We also deserve to know that you are doing something about the staff at the BWI airport!",urgent complaint confirmation number cys rr extremely disappointed drove tampa international airport waited hour told flight cancelled dca original customer service rep made announcement lied flight moved direct flight dca direct layover overnight chicago app able determine falt lied intercom husband flight direct layover chicago days later leaving tampa international airport change would caused us overnight two days tampa told hotel accommodations southwest could provide even asked norma could contact corporate said nothing could two small children one asthma would stay airport overnight days since going give us hotel accommodations inconvenience requesting put flight left originally planned norma put us flight baltimore hour half away home year old father come hour away later time pick us get baltimore wait gate opened waited minutes even able get plane fly southwest disappointing given hotel stay told earlier flight cancellation landed around pm left bwi hours looking luggage even called number customer service see could help told could tell bags asked could file claim told work customer service southwest desk representatives southwest bwi rude one person helpful lakeisha anderson person wasnt rude person helped showed true customers service customer service reps either didnt badges badges without names would like reimbursed return tickets inconvenience believe thismartha southwest customer service called able offer credit per person us traveling thought enough compensation southwest gate assistance lying fly changethe automated system putting us flight would leave days later chicago get dca offering us hotel transportation two day norma flight attendant gate southwest telling us southwest doesnt hotel vouchers didnt know would stay norma transferring us fly baltimore us dealing rude disrespectful southwest employees taking badges couldnt report spending hours airport looking luggage landed didnt get luggage shae worked find two lakeisha ended funding bringing us last luggage one helpful entire staff shae helped looked luggage threatened customers southwest offer experience per person full refund min one employees bwi southwest worked last night needs terminated acted except lakeisha ridiculous respectful one needs escalated deserve per person trying offer also deserve know something staff bwi airport
"To summarize:- A delay turned into a cancellation that should have just been a cancellation from the beginning.- Houston Southwest Hub is TERRIBLE!! (Even though their customer service was trying, the Southwest policies were just making it impossible to really help)- My LUGGAGE was SOPPING WET including everything that was inside of it! (thank God I was going to visit family and not going somewhere else but that was not the case for other people)-All in all, this was the worst experience with Southwest that I've ever had and for them to only give us a useless Hotel voucher for the evening was just Disrespectful and showed me they really don't care about their customers. Let me explain why.We traveled from Belize to St. Louis but had a layover in Houston. I normally never have any issues with Southwest; they're my go-to, but after this flight, I can NEVER travel through Houston and won't always look to Southwest as my number one.Our layover from Belize was four hours and the flight was a red-eye so we got food and relaxed for a little while we waited. As we got closer to boarding, a storm rolled through and diverted the plane to New Orleans. Not a problem at all since I hate flying when it's just cloudy. Once the storm cleared, the ticketing counter kept us updated on the re-boarding in New Orleans, the wheels being up, and them being halfway through the trip.My issue came when the flight, about 20 minutes to landing in Houston to take us back to St. Louis was suddenly canceled. At this point, it's 1 am and everyone is confused and outraged because the sky is clear. We then find out, the flight crew ran out of flying hours. Seriously!? So, throughout this entire ordeal, which took about 3- 4 hours after the initial boarding time, NO ONE calculated their flight hours until they were getting ready to land?!The icing on the cake was the rebooked flights for layover trips through Dallas to St. Louis the next morning and the hotel voucher that was basically useless! I mean seriously, it's 2 am by this time and we have to be on a flight in literally 4 hours?! In what world does leaving the airport and going to the hotel make any type of sense?We were put on a standby list for the flight that was direct to St. Louis at 5:35 am that morning and because we were in the middle of a connection, we were told we were top priority and pushed above the others who weren't in the middle of a connection. Well, that was also FALSE! If someone had A+ preferred, we were pushed down the list after them even though they weren't in the middle of a connection.The worst part is that after the horrible experience was over and we were finally in St. Louis to collect our bags, EVERYTHING WAS SOAKING WET! Essentially, it seems like during the storm, our bags were left outside unprotected and soaked by the rain. Why in the world would they leave them exposed like that? Everything smelled like mildew and was still wet, so I had to wash the entire contents of our bag and lay the electronics out to dry. Thankfully we had our laptops, but our firestick, chargers, and other things were in there. That alone really pissed me off. I just wanted to shower and change clothes and rest after 24+ hours of DOMESTIC travel that should have only been 12. But no, I had to do Laundry before I did anything else because I had nothing to change into!",summarize delay turned cancellation cancellation beginning houston southwest hub terrible even though customer service trying southwest policies making impossible really help luggage sopping wet including everything inside thank god going visit family going somewhere else case peopleall worst experience southwest ive ever give us useless hotel voucher evening disrespectful showed really dont care customers let explain whywe traveled belize st louis layover houston normally never issues southwest theyre goto flight never travel houston wont always look southwest number oneour layover belize four hours flight redeye got food relaxed little waited got closer boarding storm rolled diverted plane new orleans problem since hate flying cloudy storm cleared ticketing counter kept us updated reboarding new orleans wheels halfway tripmy issue came flight minutes landing houston take us back st louis suddenly canceled point everyone confused outraged sky clear find flight crew ran flying hours seriously throughout entire ordeal took hours initial boarding time one calculated flight hours getting ready landthe icing cake rebooked flights layover trips dallas st louis next morning hotel voucher basically useless mean seriously time flight literally hours world leaving airport going hotel make type sensewe put standby list flight direct st louis morning middle connection told top priority pushed others werent middle connection well also false someone preferred pushed list even though werent middle connectionthe worst part horrible experience finally st louis collect bags everything soaking wet essentially seems like storm bags left outside unprotected soaked rain world would leave exposed like everything smelled like mildew still wet wash entire contents bag lay electronics dry thankfully laptops firestick chargers things alone really pissed wanted shower change clothes rest hours domestic travel laundry anything else nothing change

I can only comment on my situation as we've yet to fly with Southwest.We had a flight booked and early into our US trip received a call from our home that my wife's mother was gravely Ill.

I explained in detail the circumstances we were in.They went the extra mile for us and refunded our flight even though they were under no obligation to do so.That small amount was critical at that time as we incurred substantial costs due to cancellation fees and re-booking costs.In light of what happened I can easily give them a 5 star rating.,comment situation weve yet fly southwestwe flight booked early us trip received call home wifes mother gravely ill plane hours later going back homei cancelled southwest domestic flight day later emailed asking refund explained detail circumstances inthey went extra mile us refunded flight even though obligation sothat small amount critical time incurred substantial costs due cancellation fees rebooking costsin light happened easily give star rating

Why do I pay to upgrade my seating position so I can enter and exit the flight sooner only to have people from the back shove their way to the front when it’s time to disembark. I’ve flown on a Mexican Airline Volaris where the Captain announces that there is an order to exiting a plane and it’s done by rows!!! He makes everyone remain seated until their turn. People have zero consideration anymore and are treating planes like greyhound buses. There is no flight etiquette. Passengers need to be told!!!

"Attention Southwest passengers, please take a moment to read this important message to ensure you don't miss your flight. Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning.To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding.Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again.What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business.To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery. This entire experience has further deepened my dissatisfaction.",attention southwest passengers please take moment read important message ensure dont miss flight allow share recent experience left deeply disappointed boarding pass clearly stated needed plane pm scheduled departure time pm however due disorganized nature tsa took astonishing minutes place personal belongings tray scanningto compound situation tsa officials encountered difficulties scanning daughters belongings anxiously watched clock took additional minutes complete task finally arrived gate pm respectable minutes designated boarding time mentioned boarding pass dismay however door already closed along approximately passengers faced similar delays tsa denied boardingconsequently missed flight ft lauderdale hastily book flight orlando pm landed pm top endure tiring hour drive wpb knowing work next day frequent traveler missing plane first left strong resolve never fly southwest againwhat truly bewilders stark contrast treatment delays occur numerous occasions arrived time experience flight delays various reasons customers expected accept inconveniences differential treatment delays happen us disheartening southwest unequivocally lost businessto add insult injury personally retrieve luggage ft lauderdale airport since eligible free delivery entire experience deepened dissatisfaction

"I purchased $1,500 worth of gift cards from a third party for Southwest airlines to use for our honeymoon. When I went online to use the electronic gift cards for the trip we had been looking at, the codes generated by Southwest airlines were no good. You see on Southwest gift cards you need 19 digits they only generated 16 digits so my gift cards were of no use. When I was finally able to get my money back for the gift cards from the original vendor the prices had increased and the promotions had changed. Our original trip to Mexico was going to cost about $700 per person in the trip now is between 1,000 and 1,100. After 2 weeks of trying to reach someone at Southwest that could help me I was told that there is nothing that they can do to honor the price I was going to originally purchase them at. I told them that the error and mistake was on their part and they should be liable and be able to honor the original price we were looking at. They are refusing to help but have the audacity to tell me that I'm a valued customer and that they are more than willing to help me if I agree to play 7 to 800 dollars more for the same trip.

Don’t be deceived.  I think they must be a second party travel agency. The reps are in an outside the US call center & don’t always speak good English. I had to pay for another ticket because I could not just go on the app & change my flight. My trip cost an additional $260!! So, it’s definitely not worth the “savings.” It’s so much better & easier to book through Costco Travel where they actually care about their customers!!",never use southwest vacations unless sort crazy travel emergency make difficult change flight cant swa change fees dont deceived think must second party travel agency reps outside us call center dont always speak good english pay another ticket could go app change flight trip cost additional definitely worth savings much better easier book costco travel actually care customers
"Flight delay 2 hours 40 minutes.  Was told by gate agent delay was due to having to wait on connecting passengers the prior flight, so it backed up.  Told to “wait” as they had zero flights via any connections available.  No one announced jack.  Went up to get status and was told no way to get back home for two DAYS.  This is a sunny day on the frickin’ West Coast!  I lost important medical appointment, major business meeting, etc.  The solution was ship me to another AIRPORT at my expense and a hotel at MY expense.  I complained over this and was told it was a “weather” issue and I would not get a voucher for anything!  I told them what the agent told me - a schedule delay on SW’s part…I was of course dismissed.  I am now stuck at a hotel at my expense, moved back to the original airport, two rebooking, and an 8 hour layover tomorrow (hopefully) just to get a total of a three-hour flight back.

"After last year's service debacle I was hesitant to fly Southwest again, but I'm glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent service. Their Wanna Get Away rates were the best, as always. The check-in people and crew were very friendly and our four flights were all on time.  On our return, we were delayed an hour due to severe thunderstorms in our flight path. That was understandable, but we were late for our connection in Baltimore.  Southwest knew of our problem and held the plane for us and our luggage. We were very happy when our luggage was there when we arrived in Hartford.  But most impressive was the way both return pilots handled the planes as we passed through strong turbulence on both flights. It was rough, but the pilots came through beautifully.  Overall, the experience was very good and my confidence in Southwest is back!",last years service debacle hesitant fly southwest im glad pleasantly surprised excellent service wanna get away rates best always checkin people crew friendly four flights time return delayed hour due severe thunderstorms flight path understandable late connection baltimore southwest knew problem held plane us luggage happy luggage arrived hartford impressive way return pilots handled planes passed strong turbulence flights rough pilots came beautifully overall experience good confidence southwest back

"We were traveling to Florida. to take a cruise when our luggage was delayed on our Southwest flight and forwarded to Birminghm Alabama. as detailed in our report We were delayed so long trying to find our luggage and then completing a report (MCOWN45135309) that we missed our cruise. By the way this was a direct flight from Syracuse to Orlando, we never changed planes.Initially we thought we would have time to gather some belongings as suggested by the baggage manager at southwest and we attempted to do so. If anyone has tried to gather belongings in a strange town and with limited time to buy clothing for 7 days at sea they know this an impossible task, not to mention all our medications were stored in our checked baggage. While looking for some essential items the cruise ship contacted us letting us know they would be closing the doors in 15 minutes and sailing. This was much earlier than expected. We were still 1 hour away and could not make it to the terminal on time. After explaining this to the baggage manager he demanded the compensation check back and booked us on the next flight home. Southwest refuses to compensate us for anything other than 2 pieces of toilet paper callled $200 dollar vouchers. we are out over $5000. After numerous emails and phone calls, updating claims as suggested by the phone rep., Southwest continues to claim we cancelled our vacation! NO, we were forced to cancel due to missing our cruise ship due to thier incompetence. Southwest customer service is below a 1 star and does nothing to help, just puts the blame on the customer continuing to claim we cancelled our trip....

"I always fly Southwest but lately, i have to admit, I am not thrilled. One would think after the fiasco last December with cancelling a ton of fights, Southwest would up their games, not so. I always pay extra for Early Bird, but Early Bird so it seems does not really get you anything. It is a computerized random selection of how you end up in the line. That is like going to a restaurant, paying for a Steak but you may get hot dog and sausage. The sad part, Southwest at Hobby Airport and at their customer center were completely indifferent. I am not what happens to their leadership at the top, but the lack of it is filtering all the way down to their front line operation. It is not about the $50 but if i wanted to gamble, I would go to a casino, not southwest.

"What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're IN THE AIR to Tampa, citing ""weather"".  After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% ALL OTHER AIRLINES were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality,  there were... TO DENVER! We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And..they weren't canceled!We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board.  From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep.  After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person.  Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight.  There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn’t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport.I don’t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart.  SW used to be my “go-to” airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline’s inconsistency with flights). If you read social media and travel sites, their complaint meter has increased substantially.  If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their “customary playbook” profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important.  They might be forcing people to miss weddings, funerals, births, deaths.  This is not OKAY.  Why would anyone fly them?The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts:  ""Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver...""Southwest cancelled our flight IN THE MORNING and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option.  Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us.  SW does not offer this.   Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly.  We are disgusted with the treatment we received.  They are losing loyal customers left and right.

"What an absolute joke. I don’t even know where to begin. This airline needs to be shut down immediately. They say they got their game together by the 2nd of January?! HAAA some continued comedic relief from this joke of an airline. My first flight was canceled in Indy after 3 hrs waiting in the airport then 3 hours on the plane and then disembarking. The next day I was on hold and hung up on by their stellar customer service for about 12 hours of my day. By the next day I was about 50% sure I had rebooked my flight out but obviously couldn’t get ahold of anyone to confirm and had the call dropped during my booking confirmation. By the next day, they had legitimately disconnected their customer service line. So I rented a car and drove 3 hours out of state with the hopes that I had a flight out. Upon arriving here I found out my flight was canceled again and that I was accidentally listed as a ‘no show’ after spending 3 hrs physically sitting on their plane, so I couldn’t be rebooked. No problem, I decided to drive the 18 hrs to my destination since I could no longer stand one more minute of hoping SW would throw me a bone. Now it’s been 9 days and I get to the airport in the hopes of flying home only to find out that without my consent SW had canceled my flight home and not only was I not refunded but I had to buy an additional ticket at the counter for a flight I’d already paid for making me almost miss this flight since even the counter agent couldnt understand what was going on with my ticket. I have a torn MCL and had to run the length of an entire airport to try to make this flight I had just booked. I’ve now paid for 3 flights with SW of which I’ve yet to fly any.

"I just got back from a flight/hotel with Southwest to Vegas.  I was going with my daughter who is from Austin. I flew from Love Field in Dallas to Austin.  Then met her and we flew on to Vegas.  The flight was OK but we had to sit across from each other and barely talked because of the noise. But when we got to Vegas we stayed at the MGM Grand bc we had stayed there many years ago and my daughter wanted to stay in the same hotel we had stayed in before. This time MGM was just awful..The carpet was filthy, the bathtub stopped up or toliet stopped up as well. My son had met us there and flew American. They both got mad and left me in Vegas all alone. The reason I even tell you this is because I thought I had lost my phone and was desperate in Vegas. So it was late at night and they left, I went to a security guy to see if he could help me and he flat said no.  I was shocked.  How unfriendly can anyone be even when a 71 year old woman is in deep trouble and he does nothing to help in any way.  It was so sad and so shocking.  Finally a nice lady in line waiting to speak to the front desk clerk let me call my husband.  I still cannot believe how bad it was. But then when I went to check out I found out that when you book a travel package with SW there is always an additional $40 per night that you are charged for nothing I mean nothing. They call it Resort Fees!!! No it was more like robbery fees.  They just robbed me of $120 for a filthy room that cost me for a package deal of $2359.00 plus the $40 a night for resort fees.   A bunch of crap.  I went to Oklahoma and got a brand new rood free for two nights that were just wonderful. That was what made us want to go to Vegas.

It's not their fault some people are selfish, but I feel like they should say something. If we nothing is said, they'll keep thinking it's ok. We're all in this together, it's not going to hurt you to allow someone to sit next to you for a few hours, you know it's going to happen anyways, you're just making everyone think you're a jerk.

"I’ll start with arriving to MBJ @ 9a for a 12p flight to MCO- the system was down & it took over 2 hours to get through what started as short line but the agents kept opening other lines to skip newly arriving ppl to the ticket agents b/c the line was too long into the way of walking traffic. This caused major wait time in line AND once boarded. It’s unbelievable that we waited ON THE PLANE for 1 person to finally board which took 1 hour 15min THEN another 45min for clearance from someone to go ahead & take off. You’d think the airline would rather save money and time by taking off without that 1 person b/c most of us had connecting flights that had to be rescheduled due to the 2 hour delay. Some flights had to be rescheduled until the next day, all for waiting on 1 passenger who could’ve actually made it onboard the next flight. Wait, there’s more- worse… there was a passenger seated directly behind me who wanted to please himself sexually with no regard of passengers around him & he jumped up right as we landed which caused the plane to completely stop without going to the gate for deplaning. After they got him to come out the restroom & they sat him closer to the front next to a man (thankfully) and we proceeded to gate but was instructed to remain seated until he was escorted off and then the lady sitting next to him was escorted off as well.

"I am still waiting for a final response that I assume will not come... I had a 6:20pm flight that was canceled by SW for ""operational"" reasons about 4 hours before take off.  It was NOT weather or maintenance related!  It became obvious that I was either going to be stranded in KC, Chicago, or Nashville on Aug. 29, 2022, and I only wanted to know if SW was going to cover my lodging/food expenses until I got back to CLT.  The phone rep kept saying ""I think this"" -""I think that,"" but would/could not provide a straight answer.   After almost an hour on the phone with no assurances, I purchased a ticket on another airline to get back to CLT.    If SouthWest is going to refuse to reimburse me for the ticket, then surely they should provide me with the funds that they would have had to cover for the cancelation (1-night lodging, 2 meals), but nope..... Nothing!  They simply credited back points for that 1-leg of the trip. They ignored the $ I paid to get to KC on SW.   I truly can't understand how these companies get away with jamming people with unforeseen expenses with zero accountability when they fail for ""operational"" reasons.   I would have been satisfied even had they paid me $150 of the $450 ticket I had to buy on AA to get home.  Again, not canceled because of weather or maintenance.  I tracked all SW flights that evening and had I not bought that ticket on AA, I would have been in fact stuck in Chicago or Nashville with zero assistance from Southwest!Southwest Airlines will leave you and your family stranded with zero accountability.  Sure, they will say ""I am sorry your experience has been poor,"" but try tucking those words under your head when trying to sleep as you wait 24 hours to get home!I can only hear my grandfather saying ""you get what you pay for!""",still waiting final response assume come pm flight canceled sw operational reasons hours take weather maintenance related became obvious either going stranded kc chicago nashville aug wanted know sw going cover lodgingfood expenses got back clt phone rep kept saying think think wouldcould provide straight answer almost hour phone assurances purchased ticket another airline get back clt southwest going refuse reimburse ticket surely provide funds would cover cancelation night lodging meals nope nothing simply credited back points leg trip ignored paid get kc sw truly cant understand companies get away jamming people unforeseen expenses zero accountability fail operational reasons would satisfied even paid ticket buy aa get home canceled weather maintenance tracked sw flights evening bought ticket aa would fact stuck chicago nashville zero assistance southwestsouthwest airlines leave family stranded zero accountability sure say sorry experience poor try tucking words head trying sleep wait hours get homei hear grandfather saying get pay
This is the first time I travel with Southwest and my experience is for transportation taking my customers back and fort to Denver International Airport now for any one who travels with Southwest is better for you to confirm your tickets over the phone they are every lineant when it comes to people boarding I always recommend it to my Customers the only thing I will say is that Southwest seems to be over booking and when you show up to the counter they ask if you have purchased your ticked and I can say that the ladies were saying that I was late or missed the flight I checked my bags at 4 am flight didn't leaved until 5:35 am and the lady at C59 send me to C28 with that said make sure your tickets are confirmed and plan on traveling ahead of time,first time travel southwest experience transportation taking customers back fort denver international airport one travels southwest better confirm tickets phone every lineant comes people boarding always recommend customers thing say southwest seems booking show counter ask purchased ticked say ladies saying late missed flight checked bags flight didnt leaved lady c send c said make sure tickets confirmed plan traveling ahead time

"I'm writing this from the runway, having sat here for an hour and a half. They boarded the plane without having pilots. Because of that, they couldn't turn the plane on, meaning no air despite it being 90 degrees outside. After 20 minutes when the pilots showed up, the air came on but they had a maintenance problem. That took half hour, then there was another unspecified delay for another half hour - all the while telling us every 20 minutes ""we are almost ready, any minute.""Why would you board a plane before the pilots were even at the airport? Why would you keep people on a hot plane without air instead of in the terminal? Why would you board a plane before checking it for maintenance?This used to be the best airline, before they got billions in taxpayer money as a bailout supposedly for staffing retention.Even 2 years after that bailout, they are still canceling and delaying flights constantly and lying about weather EVERY TIME when there isn't any. It's always staffing and they always lie. They have delayed or cancelled 4 of my last 5 flights.This company is no better than the rest. It does not deserve your business, as they will ALWAYS put profit over service.",im writing runway sat hour half boarded plane without pilots couldnt turn plane meaning air despite degrees outside minutes pilots showed air came maintenance problem took half hour another unspecified delay another half hour telling us every minutes almost ready minutewhy would board plane pilots even airport would keep people hot plane without air instead terminal would board plane checking maintenancethis used best airline got billions taxpayer money bailout supposedly staffing retentioneven years bailout still canceling delaying flights constantly lying weather every time isnt always staffing always lie delayed cancelled last flightsthis company better rest deserve business always put profit service

"I Love Southwest Airlines and always go to them first when I travel. However, Flight #2868, from Orlando to Dallas Love, 08/07/22, was the worst southwest flight that I have been on.

"I first flew with them in December of 2021 when I went to visit my girlfriend in Rochester NY. For starters the prices of their fares simply cannot be beat! Two free checked bags and two free carry on's per passenger just sweetens the deal! No assigned seating? YES PLEASE! Just booked a flight for me and my daughter to fly up to Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with family and round trip for both of us was only $715.96 where as any other airline would have cost us over $1,100 just for Economy! The staff is some of the friendliest I've come across and the flights were comfortable. While they don't fly into every airport at this time they are making strides to do so! Will continue to use them!

"If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  My college student canceled a flight to see his grandfather after he was tested positive for COVID.  I rebooked his flight so he could fly home at the end of his academic year.  His flight was canceled.  Since my son was flying home for an internship meeting with a delivery company (he's a logistics major) he could not be late and his original flight gave him just enough buffer.  So I asked Southwest what I should do with the unused ticket - it was originally booked in June and the flight was in April.  My son was most likely not going to fly until the school year.  I was told to make a request to SW right at one year of the original booking date.  Not a problem, until I called to ask how to do it and was told ""This is a request - we do not have to honor it.  You would get 18 months from the original booking date.  And you have to pay a $100 change fee.""  Which I repeatedly pointed out - you canceled my son's flight.  So I put this into my e-mail on 5/11/22.  On 6/1/22, I was told I was going to receive a voucher for the $211 I paid.   On 8/16, i decided to call because my voucher was not received,  My son was flying within the week for an interview and I could use that ticket.  Following the directions on the website that says ""If you are flying within a week, call us at xxx"".  So I did.  I was told the voucher was e-mailed, and they could do nothing to help me even though my son was flying within a week.  They told me to e-mail again and wait for the response in about 7-10 business days.  Again, I pointed out that he was flying within a week - that was too late.  No there are no supervisors; this is corporate, all I could do is e-mail.  And why didn't I just book him on an earlier flight?  Because he had finals and was running to make his meeting.  I was then told that even though the clock was ticking, my exp date would not change.  Flights opened up on 6/9 and I saw my son's potential flight to use this ticket from school go up steadily each day.  To add insult to injury, I was told this is a voucher and I can give it to someone else to use for a vacation.  To which I pointed out we are in a 9.1% inflation period - are they paying for my vacation?  So I e-mailed and waited again.  Then on 6/28, I was told that the voucher went out on 6/16 (although 2 other persons said it went out on 6/1) and to wait another 10 business days.   So I did and of course nothing happened.   So I did what my lawyer, and retired SW pilot told me to do: file a claim.  And keep sending over e-mails on a daily basis.  I did that on FB and through their site,  Their site said ""THis is definitely a concern.   We will get back to you in about 30 days.""  FB answer was - this is a concern and we are turning this over to a specialized group.   Purely disgusted, I took off from work on 7/19.  I first called Delta about some tickets   Off the phone within 15 minutes - received my refund within 2 hours via email.  Then called SW.   Was on the phone for 2 hours.  Finally, Jacalyn, a semi supevisor, said she would get IT to check into this.  IT could find no reason why my e-mail was not going through but admitted that something was wrong; they would send me my voucher,  I should receive it by 7/23.  Then on 7/22, I get a vms from Martha goode at SW.   They cannot send me a voucher - I would receive it via e-mail within 10 business days.  Her mistake - she left a phone number.  I left her a message askingher - well if this did not work for the last SEVEN weeks, what is going to be done when this time fails also?   And I e-mailed this.  Also, I called her today (7/25) every hour leaving a vms as to what were the plans?  SW was obviously running down the clock - already 7 weeks elapsed on using my voucher and my son's targeted ticket doubled in price - well more than my voucher.  Miracle of miracles, SW e-mailed me my vouher.  There was no problem with my e-mail; I could tell they never sent it.  And when they had to put a value on THEIR time, they finally did what they should have done in the first place.  I used to love SW, but they have demonstrated that they lie, cheat and steal from their customers.  If they stood behind their promises, I would have gone back.  It was never the money - this is pennies to what we pay in flights - but the absolute disregard for their customer which proves how they earned their nickname Southworst.    Even with all the problems, not one other airline has given me an issue and specifically REPEATED ISSUES ON THE SAME PROBLEM.  You really should be ashamed of yourselves thinking you provide any iota of customer service.  And yes, I have copies of over 20 e-mails I wrote to you, dates and times already bundled up to send to your corporate office. A certified copy was sent to the Department of Transportation by my lawyer, the retired SW pilot.  Do yourself a favor: book your flight with ANYONE else.

"My flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto a flight  that was 5 hours later. They had us board the plane where we sat for over 2 hours before the pilot came out to tell us that he was waiting for someone’s luggage before he could take off. He mentioned that we would not get drinks or snacks cause the flight was a short flight. I have pictures on my phone if the flight attendant sitting on the pilots lap in the cockpit. The pilot and his lady friend were both dismissive and rude to anyone who asked any questions. I asked if we could have some snacks while we wait and the pilot asked to see me by the cockpit. He walked me to the entrance of the plane where he told me to turn my phone off and proceeded to yell at me. He told me that he would have me arrested the second that plane landed if I opened my mouth at all during the flight. He told me he would have me banned from ever flying southwest again. I am an attorney so I said ‘I understand that all tickets are revokable’ and explained that I did not intend to offend him at which time he told me to go to my seat and if he heard that i opened my mouth to speak to a fellow passenger or to his staff that there would be ‘hell to pay’ needless to say I sat down and did not move until I landed 11 hours after the time I was supposed to land. I have been a southwest card member and have flown southwest numerous times. I have also flown on other airlines. This was the single worst travel experience I have ever had. This pilots behavior was UNCONSCIONABLE and INAPPROPRIATE and it is clear that if he did this to me, he has done this before. I am not trying to make this into a gender thing but I am a 5 foot 4 small framed lesbian woman and the pilot was a 50 year old larger white man. I don’t think it is a coincidence that he picked me to verbally degrade and berate. It in no way seemed outside his comfort zone which is really scary.

"Southwest claims to be open seating but they aren't. On my recent trip to LV I watched people reserve seats for others on all 4 flights. It's quite obvious one person upgraded to A seating and saves seats for the rest of their party. When I inquired with SW they told me that this was okay and condoned this behavior. Now I know how to scam the seating system and save a ton of money. Just purchase one A seat, and save seats for the rest for my party. Thanks SW for saving me money on my travels. Here is the response to my inquiry, I will be carrying a copy of this response just in case a flight attendant tells me I cannot save seats:""Dear Paul,Thank you for taking the time to contact us. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.I regret to hear of your disappointment on your most recent flight back to Philadelphia. All flights on Southwest are ""open-seating,"" and Customers are free to take any available seat onboard the aircraft. Understandably, Customers want to sit by their friends and family members and enjoy each other’s company. Our Flight Attendants typically don’t prevent Customers from saving seats for their friends and family members unless it interferes with our boarding process. Our hope is that early boarding Customers will not save too many seats for their traveling companions as it can be frustrating to a Customer when his/her seat of choice is being saved. Our open-seating policy comes with good points and challenges, and I am sorry you were disappointed with the handling of this particular situation.Your patronage means the world to us. We realize that it can take only one unpleasant experience to reposition our Company in a Customer’s mind, and our genuine wish is that you will not allow this occurrence to forever diminish your impression of Southwest Airlines. We hope to welcome you onboard another Southwest flight soon as we are certain more favorable circumstances will prevail.Sincerely,Alexis MartinezSouthwest Airlines""",southwest claims open seating arent recent trip lv watched people reserve seats others flights quite obvious one person upgraded seating saves seats rest party inquired sw told okay condoned behavior know scam seating system save ton money purchase one seat save seats rest party thanks sw saving money travels response inquiry carrying copy response case flight attendant tells cannot save seatsdear paulthank taking time contact us appreciate opportunity address concernsi regret hear disappointment recent flight back philadelphia flights southwest openseating customers free take available seat onboard aircraft understandably customers want sit friends family members enjoy others company flight attendants typically dont prevent customers saving seats friends family members unless interferes boarding process hope early boarding customers save many seats traveling companions frustrating customer hisher seat choice saved openseating policy comes good points challenges sorry disappointed handling particular situationyour patronage means world us realize take one unpleasant experience reposition company customers mind genuine wish allow occurrence forever diminish impression southwest airlines hope welcome onboard another southwest flight soon certain favorable circumstances prevailsincerelyalexis martinezsouthwest airlines

"We received notification that our flight was changed from 7/5/22 at 715pm to 7/6/22 at 640am due to inclement weather in Chicago.  Therefore, we had to find a hotel to stay in and extend our rental car an extra day. When we first called SWA the person that answered the phone said go to the airport and they would give us a voucher for a hotel room.  Therefore, we went to Myrtle Beach airport, explained the situation and was turned away by two different airport agents, saying we do not provide vouchers for that and they acted as if they did not care.  Therefore,  SWA was called a lady named Adrianna employee #29 was the only one that seemed to care about our inconvenience and even gave us a $150 love voucher towards our next flight for the inconvenience.  Although it did not cover the extra cost we had to pay for an extra night in a hotel, extra day of car rental and loss wages from the next day.

If it's a true service animal necessary to function that's one thing, but you can tell the difference. It's the completely untrained, uncontrolled animals that people have fudged the system to get on a plane....needs to stop.There should be a written notice that the person in the middle gets BOTH arm rests! If I have to be squished in-between overweight people (that should have to buy 2 tickets), I at least deserve the arm rests.Last, please be more forceful in telling people that are clearly bringing too many bags, that they need to check them.

"I just want to say that I’m very disappointed that people mainly get the help they need by being a loud pain in the butt. I’ve seen so many clients in vet med that scream and holler to end up getting what they want. But I politely plead for help to correct the birthdate on my boarding pass so TSA will let me through security and still catch my flight; and with zero compassion, I am told to wait in a very long, very slow moving line and then the person laughed when he said “you’re not going to be happy, the next flight isn’t until tomorrow”. It look me twice as long to wait in that line than it did to check in my bag at one of the 10+ kiosks, drop off my checked bag in one of the 4+ lines, scan my boarding pass (without anyone there so thankfully it worked) to get on a shuttle, and try to go through security in one of the 4+ checkpoints where I was told I have to go back and fix my birthdate. When I needed help from an actual human being, I was given none. I did not scream or cause a scene. I simply asked someone to please help me.",want say im disappointed people mainly get help need loud pain butt ive seen many clients vet med scream holler end getting want politely plead help correct birthdate boarding pass tsa let security still catch flight zero compassion told wait long slow moving line person laughed said youre going happy next flight isnt tomorrow look twice long wait line check bag one kiosks drop checked bag one lines scan boarding pass without anyone thankfully worked get shuttle try go security one checkpoints told go back fix birthdate needed help actual human given none scream cause scene simply asked someone please help
"Pretty bad experience, they will rebook your flight without asking you if it works with you or not. It is like they understand your schedule and priority. Even though other earlier flights has space they will not let you go on that flight. I couldn’t understand the logic. Really feel bad for the folks who are sitting at the desk and explaining to the passengers.No care for you, about your food if you are getting late there. You are just another customer for the airlines. I will recommend not to book this flight anymore.

I arranged Nashville to Las Vegas travel thru Southwest. It was a special occasion and purchased Business Select ticket and paid premium price.

Can't even book a flight if their call back system does not work as designed.  It called me back 3 x and hung up each time on me.  I am presently on hold for an 'estimated' 82 minutes to book a flight.  Now I do not even have the option of a [apparently broken] call back system. I guess their time is valuable though not mine.  After this fiasco I am also getting rid of both of my rapid rewards card as the points earned has been diminishing over the years to the point of 'what is the point of this'?

"I am writing you as an A-List member. I was originally booked on flight 308. Flight originally departed at 5:25pm, then was delayed to depart at 7pm, then my Houston flight was delayed to depart at 10:40pm, then 11:10pm, then 11:40pm, then my Cancun to Houston flight was canceled at 6:14pm. I was in the airport from 2pm - 7:30pm. I tried to call southwest, normally when i call the A-list line immediately picks up with my account info by my cell phone number. For some reason, this time (using the same cell phone number that’s on file) i had to type in my RR number. The system didn’t recognize my number, which is odd as this has never happened before. I selected the option without a RR number and the wait was 126 mins. Wow!The next day my flight to Houston was delayed. Original departure time was 1:05pm and delayed to leave at 2:22pm (flight 306). The check bag service was slow in the A-list line which caused me to not have time to check my bag and caused me to be rebooked on flight 1996 (Cancun to St. Louis). Now i am traveling 3hrs to STL and 2hrs to Dallas. Terrible service. This has been a stressful and long 2 days.I had to quickly figure out hotel plans in a foreign country in which all my family left the day before or earlier that day. Now I’m in a foreign country by myself when it was 70 people at my cousin’s wedding. I ultimately booked a hotel stay for $400. I spent another $300 on taxis and food for the night.I received a $250 voucher for a delayed flight this year (2022). I feel southwest should reimburse me for the cost of my original flight, hotel, food/taxis cost and voucher for the delays and cancellation.I do not expect to be treated like this as an A-List member.

Screwed up my flight change. Got charged more rather than a refund like I thought it would be. It was totally my fault and I really thought I was just out of luck. Since I ALWAYS get satisfaction with Southwest I gave it a try. The customer service rep had to go to her supervisor to figure out how to get me back to where I was and refund the additional charge.

"Their practice of charging to transfer Southwest (SW) rewards points from one member to another is unethical, deceitful, and easily misinterpreted! I got charged $600 to transfer 60,000 points to my daughter because she was making our reservations for 4 tickets because she had a SW credit she was using also. When she couldn't use her SW credit and the reward points she transferred them back to me and also got charged $600. We thought the charge was a ""holding fee"" and never dreamed that we were actually being charged $600. Is that even legal to be charged again for points I earned through prior purchases with my Chase SW credit card?I immediately called SW and spoke with a rep, who eventually transferred me to a specialist and both said they could do nothing. Mind you, it was an almost 2 hour call, mostly on hold! Now I have been charged $1,200 for NOTHING! This is the first, and last, time we will fly SW.In the spirit of transparency and good faith business practice, SW should not allow passengers to transfer points on-line but require them to call and speak with a SW agent. Then the agent can make sure the customer understands that they will be charged an astronomical amount to proceed with the transaction! If that was clear I would never have transferred the points and then have my daughter transfer them back to me. Obviously, we grossly misunderstood their policy on transferring points.In checking out SW reviews others have also complained of this very same thing. Not that their rating could get any worse as Better Business Bureau gave them a D rating and 1.15 out of 5 stars. Trust Pilot website rated them 1.8 stars out of 5. I'd leave a negative 1 star if I could. Obviously, they continue to practice in an unrighteous manner and the public needs to be alerted so they don’t fall victim of SW’s unethical, deceitful practice!
