# Synthesis Prototype Project
Hello all, I am Ben, a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems & Business Analytics (MS-CISBA) student at West Texas A&M University soon to graduate. I also received my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) from WTAMU. I have proficiency and knowledge in a multitude of fields within CIS such as data analytics, data science, and software development, both back-end and front-end. This repository is the culmination of my work during the MS-CISBA program along with the Southwest Airlines Review Analyzer project. 

## Structure
- Curricular Areas includes everything related to the work I have completed in the MS-CISBA program. There are a total of eight classes I took, each falling under one of the four foundational areas in the program. The four areas are Data Analytics, Data Mining and Management, Systems Development, and Networking and Cybersecurity.
  - Data Analytics Classes: Business Intelligence and Decision Support Systems (CIDM 5310) and Seminar in Data Analytics (CIDM 6308).
  - Data Mining and Management Classes: Business Data Extraction, Transformation, and Load (CIDM 6351) and Data Mining Methods (CIDM 6355).
  - Systems Development Classes: Technical Foundations in Computer Information Systems (CIDM 6303) and Electronic Commerce and Web Development (CIDM 6325)
  - Networking and Cybersecurity Classes: Networking Management and Information Security (CIDM 6340) and Digital Forensics and Fraud Detection (CIDM 6356).
- southwest-review-analysis is the main directory for the Southwest Airlines Review Analyzer web-based tool. Within it you will find everything related to how I made the project as well as how it works. 
- Report and Presentation includes three things. First is a report on my work done in the MS-CISBA program as well as the Southwest Review Analyzer project. Second is a presentation detailing the Southwest Review Analzyer project. The last item is a link to a video recording of the presentation as well as a demonstration of the project.
